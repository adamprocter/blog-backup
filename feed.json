You’ve all seen Bladerunner right? \n\nAlso Cory Doctorow evidences this much [better](https://dctr.pro/2j3) me. \n\nNeed to get some more writing on researchnot.es ans feel free to look at [alpha.adamprocter.co.uk](https://alpha.adamprocter.co.uk) \n",

				"content_html": "<p>As most people <em>should</em> know I am working on a practice based PhD (my research for now) that revolves around open practice researchnot.es and making, testing the Free Open Source Software project I have been building for supporting specific co-creation activities in design education/practice, nodenogg.in. At the start of this year the faculty suggested I could get a laptop as part of my PhD, although I am in faculty, and so I have a machine for work (MacBook Pro 2019) but I do also pay half my fees so I jumped at the chance at the potential for some other hardware. This wasnt quiet the case and I had to use some of my internal &ldquo;kick back&rdquo; funds to pay but after a long delay, however the machine arrived today. There was lots of reasons for the delay checking funding, covid etc but the big piece and the only reason I needed any additional hardware was the was also getting sign of to be able to install a Linux Distribution on University supplied hardware, I had to sign off that I would not want support and agreement for my webscience and design PhD supervisors that it was a legit request. University process is painful sometimes !</p>\n<p>Due to numerous aspects of my research work - open, ethical, inclusive and delightful. I had gotten to the point where needed to properly consider, understand and undertake development on the open platform of Linux and also I wanted to use Pop!_ OS which was a Linux distribution that looked to have been working on UX /UI for a while, Aral Balkan and Doug Belshaw had mentioned it a number of time. I had thus previously run Pop! on a VMware but I didn&rsquo;t really use it as it was a VM and I was already on my main machine running macOS.  I had attempted a simular approach with a USB-C SSD drive hooked to my mac but that didnt work. I knew I needed seperate hardware that I could use as a main machine to really test out.</p>\n<p>I had not asked for any specific hardware just something that would run the Pop! system. So today a Dell Latitude Intel i5 8th Gen 1.60GHz , 8GB ram, 500gb SSD, intel, Radeon 540X Series graphic 14&quot; laptop arrived at my house (we now have home delivery due to covid-19), I was in meetings most of the day so my wife took the parcel in. I messaged the IT team to check if I needed to do anything special to install another OS, this unfortunatly meant they had to come back and turn of the BIOS password, I couldnt even log into the system with the Universiry field machine set up anyway.</p>\n<p>Ok with the BIOS disabled I used Etcher.io to put the live OS onto a USB stick, this was hurdle one as my mac had not been set to allow this app to have the right level permissions to mount and unmount disks, I ended up running the App via sudo from terminal which forced the issue, I suspect I could have just edited security settings in Preferences but the error was not very clear it was a permission issue. The writer process has quit unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>Once permissions where updated the USB stick was ready. I plugged this in to the Dell and duck duck go searched USB boot Dell to find out how to chooise a boot device, which advised pressing f12, the Pop! website had I read on said laptops would use f1 or f7, which was not the case. f12 worked but I checked this twice as to make sure I was seeing the USB device as it appeared twice in the list. So I selected the USB stick and it restarted followed by small white text on the background which said &ldquo;You need to load the kernel first&rdquo; and nothing happened. I searched this error and it seemed I needed to turn of secure boot, I had seen this was on previously. I was happy to edit the bios settings and so disabled secure boot, which did also sent me on a bit of a deadend reboot once when it tried to restarted into the pre installed windows, this was not allowed and I entered something called BitRecovery. Which was a little concerned as it was asking for codes and I was worried I would lock myself out but I managed to navigate a reboot and get back into the f12 boot and tried again.</p>\n<p>This time I was presented with the test or install Pop message and a reboot count down. The screen the went blank and stayed blank, I waited and waited as I assumed it maybe slow from the USB stick but nothing happened. A further search suggested it maybe to do with UEFI bios mode and that I should switch to legacy boot mode, this option was not present but I noticed on the offical pop install screenshots it said UEFI so I concluded it must be something else. I was concerned my GPU was prehaps not supported, and there was a lot of talk about rufus mode (no idea). I then found a post that had another line that advised when you see the visual test and install Pop prompt you should press the letter e and the following line should say gfxpayload=text. When I entered the special e location I saw gfxplayload=keep, I edited this and hit Ctrl-X. This time after counting down the reboot displayed line after lines of thinking happening and then the install screen appeared &hellip; progress!</p>\n<p>Pop then installed no problem, I didnt encypt the drive, the setup was simple to follow and I was worried about the keyboard as I am very use to @ being on the number 2, and was plesantly suprised I could pick UK machintosh keyboard layout and test it out, as my muscle memory is going to struggle anought with CTRL over CMD, I might see if I can remap some other options, Super (the &ldquo;windows&rdquo; key) + /  for search for example is testing my cmd + space to open alfred however I set up my user no problem and a little later on I was promoted for some dell/ system updates including firmware update to 1.7.5 which I think suggested I can enable Secure Boot again (not sure why I need it yet mind).</p>\n<p>Firefox was preinstalled and so I logged into my Firefox account which was great. I then opened the Pop!_ Shop to install VSCode and others, I searched and installed VSCode but it wasnt the official one so that was confusing, but easily rectified. I then went to get Obsidian and both files I downloaded a snap and an appimage didnt just install either like an exe or like macOS (drag and drop from an disk image), It offered to search the store but turned up no results, I then looked online to install GitKraken which also offered a number of installs again this was confusing too but it also said Snap Store, so I decided that this store might be the best approach, I was then able to use terminal to install snap and the then desktop snap store,at first I didnt think the snap desktop store had installed but a restart, as advised in one guide fixed this, and enabled me to install Gitkraken and an Apple Music client (a browser wrapper, althought it also asked to installa DRM app and yet didnt work for play back, but neither did logging in via firefox)</p>\n<p>The obsidian snap app was not on the store and when I tried to use terminal to install I was presented with a warning error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap, so another search later and I added the line &ndash;dangerous and it installed. I also installed Syncthing from the Pop Shop. This added a folder called Sync, I went to check out the webpage which also suggests installing a GTK, GUI for Syncthing, the Pop Shop had this but again like the unofficial VS Code it is labeled as flathub flatpak, I searched the store again and found the Debian build? It seems to be working. I have to connect my two devices now my mac and Pop! I want to do this so I can use Obsidian to write on both machines.

				"content_text": "As most people _should_ know I am working on a practice based PhD (my research for now) that revolves around open practice researchnot.es and making, testing the Free Open Source Software project I have been building for supporting specific co-creation activities in design education/practice, nodenogg.in. At the start of this year the faculty suggested I could get a laptop as part of my PhD, although I am in faculty, and so I have a machine for work (MacBook Pro 2019) but I do also pay half my fees so I jumped at the chance at the potential for some other hardware. This wasnt quiet the case and I had to use some of my internal \"kick back\" funds to pay but after a long delay, however the machine arrived today. There was lots of reasons for the delay checking funding, covid etc but the big piece and the only reason I needed any additional hardware was the was also getting sign of to be able to install a Linux Distribution on University supplied hardware, I had to sign off that I would not want support and agreement for my webscience and design PhD supervisors that it was a legit request. University process is painful sometimes !\r\n\r\nDue to numerous aspects of my research work - open, ethical, inclusive and delightful. I had gotten to the point where needed to properly consider, understand and undertake development on the open platform of Linux and also I wanted to use Pop!_ OS which was a Linux distribution that looked to have been working on UX /UI for a while, Aral Balkan and Doug Belshaw had mentioned it a number of time. I had thus previously run Pop! on a VMware but I didn't really use it as it was a VM and I was already on my main machine running macOS.  I had attempted a simular approach with a USB-C SSD drive hooked to my mac but that didnt work. I knew I needed seperate hardware that I could use as a main machine to really test out.\r\n\r\nI had not asked for any specific hardware just something that would run the Pop! system. So today a Dell Latitude Intel i5 8th Gen 1.60GHz , 8GB ram, 500gb SSD, intel, Radeon 540X Series graphic 14\" laptop arrived at my house (we now have home delivery due to covid-19), I was in meetings most of the day so my wife took the parcel in. I messaged the IT team to check if I needed to do anything special to install another OS, this unfortunatly meant they had to come back and turn of the BIOS password, I couldnt even log into the system with the Universiry field machine set up anyway.\r\n\r\nOk with the BIOS disabled I used Etcher.io to put the live OS onto a USB stick, this was hurdle one as my mac had not been set to allow this app to have the right level permissions to mount and unmount disks, I ended up running the App via sudo from terminal which forced the issue, I suspect I could have just edited security settings in Preferences but the error was not very clear it was a permission issue. The writer process has quit unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nOnce permissions where updated the USB stick was ready. I plugged this in to the Dell and duck duck go searched USB boot Dell to find out how to chooise a boot device, which advised pressing f12, the Pop! website had I read on said laptops would use f1 or f7, which was not the case. f12 worked but I checked this twice as to make sure I was seeing the USB device as it appeared twice in the list. So I selected the USB stick and it restarted followed by small white text on the background which said \"You need to load the kernel first\" and nothing happened. I searched this error and it seemed I needed to turn of secure boot, I had seen this was on previously. I was happy to edit the bios settings and so disabled secure boot, which did also sent me on a bit of a deadend reboot once when it tried to restarted into the pre installed windows, this was not allowed and I entered something called BitRecovery. Which was a little concerned as it was asking for codes and I was worried I would lock myself out but I managed to navigate a reboot and get back into the f12 boot and tried again.\r\n\r\nThis time I was presented with the test or install Pop message and a reboot count down. The screen the went blank and stayed blank, I waited and waited as I assumed it maybe slow from the USB stick but nothing happened. A further search suggested it maybe to do with UEFI bios mode and that I should switch to legacy boot mode, this option was not present but I noticed on the offical pop install screenshots it said UEFI so I concluded it must be something else. I was concerned my GPU was prehaps not supported, and there was a lot of talk about rufus mode (no idea). I then found a post that had another line that advised when you see the visual test and install Pop prompt you should press the letter e and the following line should say gfxpayload=text. When I entered the special e location I saw gfxplayload=keep, I edited this and hit Ctrl-X. This time after counting down the reboot displayed line after lines of thinking happening and then the install screen appeared ... progress!\r\n\r\nPop then installed no problem, I didnt encypt the drive, the setup was simple to follow and I was worried about the keyboard as I am very use to @ being on the number 2, and was plesantly suprised I could pick UK machintosh keyboard layout and test it out, as my muscle memory is going to struggle anought with CTRL over CMD, I might see if I can remap some other options, Super (the \"windows\" key) + /  for search for example is testing my cmd + space to open alfred however I set up my user no problem and a little later on I was promoted for some dell/ system updates including firmware update to 1.7.5 which I think suggested I can enable Secure Boot again (not sure why I need it yet mind).\r\n\r\nFirefox was preinstalled and so I logged into my Firefox account which was great. I then opened the Pop!_ Shop to install VSCode and others, I searched and installed VSCode but it wasnt the official one so that was confusing, but easily rectified. I then went to get Obsidian and both files I downloaded a snap and an appimage didnt just install either like an exe or like macOS (drag and drop from an disk image), It offered to search the store but turned up no results, I then looked online to install GitKraken which also offered a number of installs again this was confusing too but it also said Snap Store, so I decided that this store might be the best approach, I was then able to use terminal to install snap and the then desktop snap store,at first I didnt think the snap desktop store had installed but a restart, as advised in one guide fixed this, and enabled me to install Gitkraken and an Apple Music client (a browser wrapper, althought it also asked to installa DRM app and yet didnt work for play back, but neither did logging in via firefox)\r\n\r\nThe obsidian snap app was not on the store and when I tried to use terminal to install I was presented with a warning error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap, so another search later and I added the line --dangerous and it installed. I also installed Syncthing from the Pop Shop. This added a folder called Sync, I went to check out the webpage which also suggests installing a GTK, GUI for Syncthing, the Pop Shop had this but again like the unofficial VS Code it is labeled as flathub flatpak, I searched the store again and found the Debian build? It seems to be working. I have to connect my two devices now my mac and Pop! I want to do this so I can use Obsidian to write on both machines. I will do some testing again conflicting files as well as I know Obsidian are looking to launch there own sync service but that is not out yet and another monthly subscription. I installed Filezilla, last on my to do although, Apple Music was a diversion, and needs fixing / deleting and Iam a little concerned about the extra thing it installed, I did download Discord as I think I will want to connect that but only to my own discord.\r\n\r\nI keep rolling my mouse to the left to get the activities dock to appear, on macOS my dock is visible on the left, and I need to work out how to \"hide\" windows. Of to read up on the shortcuts, so far seems very nice and the machine itself seem nice to use and the screen although not retina is bright and clear. Spellcheck in firefox doesnt seem to be working in the micro.blog web posting text area.\r\n\r\nMost of the above wasnt painful but it wasnt seemless and installing apps was a little triicky if not in the Pop Shop and installing the Snap Shop involved terminal. If I was buying a machine I would look at the Pinebooks, I have not read up if they work with Pop, I should expect so.\r\n\r\nn.b Apple Music started worked CONTENT_EQUIVALENT error was an Apple issue, will work out if the extra DRM thing for Apple Music is bad or not at some point.\n",

				"title": "Diversity is Good for the Games Industries",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Today there are approximately 2.6 Billion people playing video Games. This group is not just men, in fact it is a really diverse audience. This group is almost evenly split in terms of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gender<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (52% identify as female in last major survey in 2014). When you dive into some of the detail we see areas where there are, for example more middle age women playing video Games than teenage boys (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nesta 2017<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). This clearly indicates the appetite for game types is also in fact very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->diverse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Games are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->biggest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> consumed media on the planet now and so this means they have the capacity to do more than just entertain. They can enable social good (Pokemon Go Earth day Clean up), produce empathy around migration (Papers Please) , Cancer (That Dragon Cancer) or give insight into Mental health (Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creative Review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suggests Games are the future of storytelling and so to speak and tackle broad issues and audiences through this medium we must have a group of diverse makers.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting this is often not the way main stream media portrays Games. They tend to focus on the same types of titles and genres, which also has an impact on the understanding of game. Or worse. We must work to combat this stereotyping.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Guardian is an excellent example of opposition to this with Games featured under <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Culture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and not under entertainment or toys for example.</p>\n<p>So we know there is diverse audience and diverse players but those working in the “Games industry” are still predominantly white men. The workforce in the UK identifies as 28% female and 20% worldwide. This is a complex and multi-faceted issue but is in part due to the wider issue of Technology, Engineering and Computer Science having the same issues.  Some of the historical context of this largely lies around the marketing of technology in the 1980s with a focus on these things being for boys and we know that Schools and marketing still skew that interest in technology.</p>\n<p>A great example of a product that is already combating this within Engineering and girls is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoldieBlox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the argument that there is any biological difference is factually incorrect, data from across the world in fact shows girls out performing boys in science tests in fact, and yet there interest in the Science Technology Engineering and maths (STEM) subjects drops at around 15 years old and never recovers.</p>\n<p>GoldieBlox uses storytelling with STEM principles as extensive testing with girls showed this type of interaction appealed much more to girls than for example Lego&rsquo;s attempts in this regard by just making the boxes pink.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The voices of many people are needed to create great and compelling Games for all people and the powerful potential of Games to unite people can only be unlocked if we have a diverse representation of people making these products. Why would any industry not want to have diversity?</p>\n<p>Can we make it change? The stats are already showing a rise of diversity in the Games industries themselves and in the diversity of makers but there is much work to be done which starts at Schools and Universities. This includes educating against discrimination, encouraging participation and showcasing role models.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>From the inception of the course at WSA we knew based on the industry and are position, we wanted to and where in a place to encourage diversity into making Games. We understood the power Games would have and where Games where heading, although already a huge industry in 2013, the direction of future travel was very exciting, we are really only just seeing the impact of this exciting medium. The V&amp;A in 2019 called Games design one of the most significant design fields of our time.</p>\n<p>Connected to this concept we knew and had working knowledge of the game engine Unity. The engine was well established and was well on its way to achieve its goal of democratising game making.</p>\n<p>It had been doing this as its focus was on creativity, it has an editor that was powerful yet visual and including things such as simple drag and drop capabilities, this meant many more people could just start to quickly realise an idea without a focus on the technology. Unity is all about bringing ideas to life, without a focus on how great the technology is but a focus on enabling creativity. Something like Media Molecules Dreams is probably the next phase in the arena of what has been coined in the past as Game 3.0.</p>\n<p>Also having taught coding and interaction design skills to students within an Art School for well over 10 years I was also acutely aware of how off putting coding can be for anyone who wants to be creative, it can be very stifling, and a barrier to entry. This is often because of a focus on the technology rather than the manifestation of the idea or intent through the use of appropriate media.</p>\n<p>I had personally seen with my background in interaction design, the alienation of women, at events and online and I have 3 daughters whom I encouraged to do whatever they were passionate about yet saw and heard discouraging comments around what is for girls and what is for boys.</p>\n<p>With all this in mind we developed a course that uses design thinking and making through the lens of Games to tell stories, provide emotional moments and more. We didn’t focus on technology and we didn’t focus on only video Games, we focussed on research, ideas and manifesting them in game artefacts.</p>\n<p>We knew this would draw diverse people to the course, also by situating our course within WSA, the University of Southampton’s Art School and not within the Computer Science Faculty we could really push the way we teach Games and the approach of what Games are. These opportunities allowed the creation of a unique course of study situated within Games.</p>\n<p>What we do in our course is some simple but deliberate things, we make very sure all our decisions include diversity. And so we look to feature that diversity by making active and conscious design choices with any of our processes and outputs to ensure there is diverse representation.

This group is not just men, in fact it is a really diverse audience. This group is almost evenly split in terms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/women-video-Games-iab\">gender</a> (52% identify as female in last major survey in 2014). When you dive into some of the detail we see areas where there are, for example more middle age women playing video Games than teenage boys (<a href=\"https://www.nesta.org.uk/news/new-research-proves-cultural-value-of-video-gaming/\">Nesta 2017</a>). This clearly indicates the appetite for game types is also in fact very <a href=\"https://newzoo.com/insights/infographics/newzoos-gamer-segmentation-the-ultimate-gamer-explained/\">diverse</a>.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/2c8de70d4e.png\" alt=\"Newzoo 2019 Global Games Market per Segment\" title=\"Newzoo-2019-Global-Games-Market-per-Segment.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" /> \n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/45b9e93136.png\" alt=\"Newzoo Global Games Market 2018 to 2022\" title=\"Newzoo-Global-Games-Market-2018-to-2022.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" />\n\nGames are the <a href=\"https://www.wepc.com/news/video-game-statistics/\">biggest</a> consumed media on the planet now and so this means they have the capacity to do more than just entertain. They can enable social good (Pokemon Go Earth day Clean up), produce empathy around migration (Papers Please) , Cancer (That Dragon Cancer) or give insight into Mental health (Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice). <a href=\"https://www.creativereview.co.uk/artist-paloma-dawkins-Games-are-the-future-of-storytelling/\">Creative Review</a> suggests Games are the future of storytelling and so to speak and tackle broad issues and audiences through this medium we must have a group of diverse makers.\n \nIt is worth noting this is often not the way main stream media portrays Games. They tend to focus on the same types of titles and genres, which also has an impact on the understanding of game. Or worse. We must work to combat this stereotyping.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/809c77f070.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 03 05 at 12 31 44\" title=\"Screenshot 2020-03-05 at 12.31.44.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"598\" height=\"411\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/d80edc5c6c.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 03 05 at 12 32 37\" title=\"Screenshot 2020-03-05 at 12.32.37.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"440\" height=\"600\" />\n\nThe Guardian is an excellent example of opposition to this with Games featured under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/Games\">Culture</a> and not under entertainment or toys for example.\n \nSo we know there is diverse audience and diverse players but those working in the “Games industry” are still predominantly white men. The workforce in the UK identifies as 28% female and 20% worldwide. This is a complex and multi-faceted issue but is in part due to the wider issue of Technology, Engineering and Computer Science having the same issues.  Some of the historical context of this largely lies around the marketing of technology in the 1980s with a focus on these things being for boys and we know that Schools and marketing still skew that interest in technology.\n \nA great example of a product that is already combating this within Engineering and girls is <a href=\"https://goldieblox.com/\">GoldieBlox</a>, the argument that there is any biological difference is factually incorrect, data from across the world in fact shows girls out performing boys in science tests in fact, and yet there interest in the Science Technology Engineering and maths (STEM) subjects drops at around 15 years old and never recovers.\n \nGoldieBlox uses storytelling with STEM principles as extensive testing with girls showed this type of interaction appealed much more to girls than for example Lego's attempts in this regard by just making the boxes pink.\n\n \n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/de68be4262.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020 03 09 at 14 41 21\" title=\"Screenshot 2020-03-09 at 14.41.21.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"450\" />\n\nThe voices of many people are needed to create great and compelling Games for all people and the powerful potential of Games to unite people can only be unlocked if we have a diverse representation of people making these products. Why would any industry not want to have diversity?\n \nCan we make it change? The stats are already showing a rise of diversity in the Games industries themselves and in the diversity of makers but there is much work to be done which starts at Schools and Universities. This includes educating against discrimination, encouraging participation and showcasing role models.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/fb8b2df423.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 9654\" title=\"IMG_9654.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n \n \nFrom the inception of the course at WSA we knew based on the industry and are position, we wanted to and where in a place to encourage diversity into making Games. We understood the power Games would have and where Games where heading, although already a huge industry in 2013, the direction of future travel was very exciting, we are really only just seeing the impact of this exciting medium. The V&A in 2019 called Games design one of the most significant design fields of our time.\n \nConnected to this concept we knew and had working knowledge of the game engine Unity. The engine was well established and was well on its way to achieve its goal of democratising game making.\n \nIt had been doing this as its focus was on creativity, it has an editor that was powerful yet visual and including things such as simple drag and drop capabilities, this meant many more people could just start to quickly realise an idea without a focus on the technology. Unity is all about bringing ideas to life, without a focus on how great the technology is but a focus on enabling creativity. Something like Media Molecules Dreams is probably the next phase in the arena of what has been coined in the past as Game 3.0.\n \nAlso having taught coding and interaction design skills to students within an Art School for well over 10 years I was also acutely aware of how off putting coding can be for anyone who wants to be creative, it can be very stifling, and a barrier to entry. This is often because of a focus on the technology rather than the manifestation of the idea or intent through the use of appropriate media.\n \nI had personally seen with my background in interaction design, the alienation of women, at events and online and I have 3 daughters whom I encouraged to do whatever they were passionate about yet saw and heard discouraging comments around what is for girls and what is for boys.\n\nWith all this in mind we developed a course that uses design thinking and making through the lens of Games to tell stories, provide emotional moments and more. We didn’t focus on technology and we didn’t focus on only video Games, we focussed on research, ideas and manifesting them in game artefacts.\n \nWe knew this would draw diverse people to the course, also by situating our course within WSA, the University of Southampton’s Art School and not within the Computer Science Faculty we could really push the way we teach Games and the approach of what Games are. These opportunities allowed the creation of a unique course of study situated within Games.  \n \nWhat we do in our course is some simple but deliberate things, we make very sure all our decisions include diversity. And so we look to feature that diversity by making active and conscious design choices with any of our processes and outputs to ensure there is diverse representation. Students work in teams and we mix them up for each project, considering their background alongside their current skillsets.\n \nWe as a team of staff and of our students are also made aware of the unconscious bias that can creep into our every day life and so we take deliberate actions to combat this. This can be as simple as adapting the language we use. We make sure all of our text is gender neutral and we actively seek out and test this with our students, even this blog post was discussed with our current year 3 students to see if this was accurate and agreeable to them.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2020/70c62e421e.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 9842\" title=\"IMG_9842.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /> \n\nAt open days and interview days we ensure a diversity of students are represented from Games on campus. This we know that has a direct impacts on ensuring diverse recruitment, students have stated that this is what enabled them to see themselves at WSA studying Games, because they see someone like them. This is often coupled with the realisation they have every right to want to make Games as anyone else.\n \nWe are careful to pick media and outputs that do not reinforce the stereotypical idea of Games, for example our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O_xh-ea-rs\">course film</a> has conscious efforts to showcase diversity.

Apple should be rushing to address this not just fire people (I understand they don’t work directly for Apple). Like many (iOS geeks) I love to keep screenshots of Siri's wonderful mistakes and would have been happy to send various recordings of them … all Apple had to do was just ask me.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This is part 3 of a 3 part blog, part 1 “Misunderstandings of the history of indie development and how the Rezzed panel sold short the significance of indie” can be read <a href=\"https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Part 2 &ldquo;Why indie is still important, developer’s motivations and the value of games education&rdquo; can be read <a href=\"https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/08/indie-games-are.html\">here</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"part-3-unlocking-the-huge-potential-of-indie-by-challenging-the-attitudes-of-the-industry\">Part 3: Unlocking the huge potential of indie by challenging the attitudes of the industry.</h2>\n<p>I fundamentally believe we need games that speak to and from a diverse audience and this means taking risks and making projects that do not consider the bottom line or return on investment as the primary motivator. Indie game making is not, as the Rezzed panel seemed to suggest, just to provide a route into the industry.</p>\n<p>Games are huge. Games are the biggest entertainment medium on the planet. This provides a massive audience with diverse tastes. And this is a massive audience that can be spoken to. We see the systematic destruction of the planet, the rise in fear of ‘the other’ and communities breaking down. There is a power to be had in games as art, and games as social commentary, an opportunity to hold a mirror up to the world and see things differently.</p>\n<p>Due to the popularity of Games they are in a unique position to do more than just entertain the 40 million plus players. Might this position be harnessed and become a force for good, a place for anyone to tell their story? Further, the creative thinking and the creative nature of games could be one of the puzzle pieces used to help solve some of the planet’s biggest problems to date: global warming and political unrest to name but two.</p>\n<p>So, my call to action is that UKIE and the industry should do much more to encourage the truly creative side of games in the UK. The ‘indie’ panel discussion focus on skills, money, business planning and ‘what the ‘industry’ wants’ does little to encourage or ensure that there continues to be a diverse community of makers, lead not just by white men, money, and publishers that have “made it”.</p>\n<p>We should note as well that the industry at one end has unstable employment, developer burn out and more games being made by contracting ‘teams’. While those making ‘indie’ games need to have a day job to support themselves and ensure they have the business acumen to go cap in hand to the publishers, who are not disposed to take risks. Where is the investment in new companies and creative start-ups?</p>\n<p>There was some brief discussion on trickle down payment streaming services: making games that are twitchable or supporting games via services such as the Venture Capital (VC) backed Patreon. Although none of these options where discussed in much depth and the discussion was connected to looking at other industries that have seen change via digital disruption, specifically pointing to the music industry. The picture painted was that Games would move towards a market of the Beyoncé’s and the artists living off Bandcamp or subsidiary sales such as merchandise to sustain making ‘indie’ games. What a dividing and terrible situation. The Music industry is not in a good place. This is not a sustainable future I would want for games. So why not think differently? Why doesn&rsquo;t UKIE lobby companies and governments to invest in these creative endeavours?

				"content_text": "This is part 3 of a 3 part blog, part 1 “Misunderstandings of the history of indie development and how the Rezzed panel sold short the significance of indie” can be read [here](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html). \n\nPart 2 \"Why indie is still important, developer’s motivations and the value of games education\" can be read [here](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/08/indie-games-are.html)\n\n## Part 3: Unlocking the huge potential of indie by challenging the attitudes of the industry.\n\nI fundamentally believe we need games that speak to and from a diverse audience and this means taking risks and making projects that do not consider the bottom line or return on investment as the primary motivator. Indie game making is not, as the Rezzed panel seemed to suggest, just to provide a route into the industry. \n\nGames are huge. Games are the biggest entertainment medium on the planet. This provides a massive audience with diverse tastes. And this is a massive audience that can be spoken to. We see the systematic destruction of the planet, the rise in fear of ‘the other’ and communities breaking down. There is a power to be had in games as art, and games as social commentary, an opportunity to hold a mirror up to the world and see things differently.\n\nDue to the popularity of Games they are in a unique position to do more than just entertain the 40 million plus players. Might this position be harnessed and become a force for good, a place for anyone to tell their story? Further, the creative thinking and the creative nature of games could be one of the puzzle pieces used to help solve some of the planet’s biggest problems to date: global warming and political unrest to name but two.\n\nSo, my call to action is that UKIE and the industry should do much more to encourage the truly creative side of games in the UK. The ‘indie’ panel discussion focus on skills, money, business planning and ‘what the ‘industry’ wants’ does little to encourage or ensure that there continues to be a diverse community of makers, lead not just by white men, money, and publishers that have “made it”.\n\nWe should note as well that the industry at one end has unstable employment, developer burn out and more games being made by contracting ‘teams’. While those making ‘indie’ games need to have a day job to support themselves and ensure they have the business acumen to go cap in hand to the publishers, who are not disposed to take risks. Where is the investment in new companies and creative start-ups?\n\nThere was some brief discussion on trickle down payment streaming services: making games that are twitchable or supporting games via services such as the Venture Capital (VC) backed Patreon. Although none of these options where discussed in much depth and the discussion was connected to looking at other industries that have seen change via digital disruption, specifically pointing to the music industry. The picture painted was that Games would move towards a market of the Beyoncé’s and the artists living off Bandcamp or subsidiary sales such as merchandise to sustain making ‘indie’ games. What a dividing and terrible situation. The Music industry is not in a good place. This is not a sustainable future I would want for games. So why not think differently? Why doesn't UKIE lobby companies and governments to invest in these creative endeavours? The panel touched on mid-size companies folding or closing down and connected this to bad business, but I suspect this is a very simplistic view of the situation and again likely more related to demands for return on investment and VC exits. \n\nItch.io continues to be very interesting. Why not invest in a space for UK makers within itch.io? Perhaps UKIE already do? Why not look at the model of investment in the Arts in Canada? The UK games tax break is good, but the ability for only match funding schemes in the UK is very poor.

The few games the panel held up as indie included The Cultist Simulator which cost £140k+ to produce and Monument Valley which had nearly £2million in initial investment. In a year in which UKIE released stats showing a record spend on games in the UK where is this money going? Where could a new game maker or makers get access to this type investment, if this is what’s needed to make any game for market? Thus, the discussion ended up revolving mainly around how even indie game makers must become business savvy.</p>\n<p>The panel mentioned Unity 3d (2005) and Unity’s position and claim to have helped democratise game making - which I agree with. When Unity came out it was a moment when I also thought ‘Wow - this will be how creatives and artists could start to speak via games’, and they did. However, I have to note that at the time, most of the ‘industry’ laughed at the release during Apples WWDC in 2005. “You can&rsquo;t make games on macOS” was the cry. And only a few years ago another educator tried to belittle me and our choice to use Unity as our main engine, when in general conversation they advised me “you know that’s not industry standard”. The thoughts of what education is for also echoed in my mind at this point and it’s certainly not to teach Unity or Unreal.</p>\n<p>The Graveyard (Belgium, 2009) is a fantastic example of what Unity could and would go on to do. Yet how can the so-called budget requirements mentioned support ongoing democratisation?</p>\n<p>In 2008 the UK based Media Molecule released Little Big Planet and Sony talked about Game 3.0. Games that would allow players to be creators; consumers could become creators. We are now closer than ever to realising Game 3.0. In fact, a decade later, a recent Edge (March 2018) article nodded towards this and got me excited again. But this can only happen if we encourage creatives to use these tools and not be concerned with the commercial potential of their ideas. It is clear that Media Molecules Dreams is this type of Game 3.0 tool.</p>\n<p>I have since spoken to some of the Media Molecule team and asked directly about paid content creation, which although currently is not an option, it is something they have thought about and very much see the value of paying creators. So we as artists and designers need to push developers such as Media Molecule, to not take advantage of free content producers. Those companies that start to pioneer in this emerging Game 3.0 field will no doubt draw more talent to the industry, with possibly interesting and sustainable business models for content creators. I will touch on the concepts of monetisation the panel nodded towards in my third post, but you may have guessed I didn’t agree with the panel’s thoughts on parallels towards following the music industry.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the panel discussion, one piece of advice was to not waste money on a Games Development course at University, and the suggestion that you can learn Games Development via a Google search. The panel were heard to laugh in agreement at this statement. Now I am a huge advocate of open education resources and I once learnt how to fix a problem with part of my car on YouTube; however, that doesn&rsquo;t make me a mechanic and I wouldn&rsquo;t advocate all mechanics should learn their trade on YouTube. Throw-away comments such as these, and other concerning trends, see people like Peter Thiel offering $100k “to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom”. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of education.</p>\n<p>I believe each panel member had a degree, albeit not in games, so I must assume they do in fact value the usefulness of higher education. In view of this, perhaps the wording of the statement should have been more carefully selected, or otherwise qualified, rather than being diminishing and dismissive. The benefit of working cooperatively with educators is much more useful than bashing them. Universities offer much more than skills.</p>\n<p>If we agree that the way to solve some of the most complex problems is through creative thinking, then I am confident Universities offer this space through a variety of subjects. And I happen to think Games is a very strong area in which to apply this type of thinking.</p>\n<p>Young people need to build confidence, collaborative skills, design thinking and creative investigation in order to create exciting and innovative games, be that for entertainment or social good. They also need structure and deadlines, and you can&rsquo;t learn that from YouTube. I am learning the Godot Game Engine via Youtube and some paid Kickstarter content however my process of thinking was transformed by Art School and I know this still positively affects me today. I don&rsquo;t think I can put it better than Douglas Rushkoff did in a recent <a href=\"http://dctr.pro/2d0\">article</a> so I am just going to quote from him here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>School (University) is a means of promoting not social control, or even productivity, but the higher value of learning itself. School (University) is less valuable for the information or skills transmitted than the mimesis — the live mirroring and modelling — through which students learn to think critically, develop rapport, and establish solidarity. School (University) is not directed at our utilitarian value, but our essential, intrinsic dignity. How profoundly sad it is that many of us think of a Harvard education more as a professional credential than a pinnacle of humanism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IK5QDAhmAdQ\">talk</a> I attended later, from the designer of Knights and Bikes, was excellent and his Art School Education was clearly evident in the level of detail in the game and the way the game is likely to speak to players. His final slide of a death metal poster where one band clearly stood out was a call for game makers to be that band. To be different and to say something through games.

				"content_text": "This is part 2 of a 3 part blog, part 1 “Misunderstandings of the history of indie development and how the Rezzed panel sold short the significance of indie” can be read [here](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html).\n\n## Part 2: Why indie is still important, developer’s motivations and the value of games education.\n\nThe Rezzed panel discussion highlighted to me a worrying parallel with the changes in the emergent UK indie scene and our present moment in the industry. The few games the panel held up as indie included The Cultist Simulator which cost £140k+ to produce and Monument Valley which had nearly £2million in initial investment. In a year in which UKIE released stats showing a record spend on games in the UK where is this money going? Where could a new game maker or makers get access to this type investment, if this is what’s needed to make any game for market? Thus, the discussion ended up revolving mainly around how even indie game makers must become business savvy. \n\nThe panel mentioned Unity 3d (2005) and Unity’s position and claim to have helped democratise game making - which I agree with. When Unity came out it was a moment when I also thought ‘Wow - this will be how creatives and artists could start to speak via games’, and they did. However, I have to note that at the time, most of the ‘industry’ laughed at the release during Apples WWDC in 2005. “You can't make games on macOS” was the cry. And only a few years ago another educator tried to belittle me and our choice to use Unity as our main engine, when in general conversation they advised me “you know that’s not industry standard”. The thoughts of what education is for also echoed in my mind at this point and it’s certainly not to teach Unity or Unreal. \n\nThe Graveyard (Belgium, 2009) is a fantastic example of what Unity could and would go on to do. Yet how can the so-called budget requirements mentioned support ongoing democratisation?\n\nIn 2008 the UK based Media Molecule released Little Big Planet and Sony talked about Game 3.0. Games that would allow players to be creators; consumers could become creators. We are now closer than ever to realising Game 3.0. In fact, a decade later, a recent Edge (March 2018) article nodded towards this and got me excited again. But this can only happen if we encourage creatives to use these tools and not be concerned with the commercial potential of their ideas. It is clear that Media Molecules Dreams is this type of Game 3.0 tool. \n\nI have since spoken to some of the Media Molecule team and asked directly about paid content creation, which although currently is not an option, it is something they have thought about and very much see the value of paying creators. So we as artists and designers need to push developers such as Media Molecule, to not take advantage of free content producers. Those companies that start to pioneer in this emerging Game 3.0 field will no doubt draw more talent to the industry, with possibly interesting and sustainable business models for content creators. I will touch on the concepts of monetisation the panel nodded towards in my third post, but you may have guessed I didn’t agree with the panel’s thoughts on parallels towards following the music industry.\n\nTowards the end of the panel discussion, one piece of advice was to not waste money on a Games Development course at University, and the suggestion that you can learn Games Development via a Google search. The panel were heard to laugh in agreement at this statement. Now I am a huge advocate of open education resources and I once learnt how to fix a problem with part of my car on YouTube; however, that doesn't make me a mechanic and I wouldn't advocate all mechanics should learn their trade on YouTube. Throw-away comments such as these, and other concerning trends, see people like Peter Thiel offering $100k “to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom”. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of education.\n\nI believe each panel member had a degree, albeit not in games, so I must assume they do in fact value the usefulness of higher education. In view of this, perhaps the wording of the statement should have been more carefully selected, or otherwise qualified, rather than being diminishing and dismissive. The benefit of working cooperatively with educators is much more useful than bashing them. Universities offer much more than skills. \n\nIf we agree that the way to solve some of the most complex problems is through creative thinking, then I am confident Universities offer this space through a variety of subjects. And I happen to think Games is a very strong area in which to apply this type of thinking.\n\nYoung people need to build confidence, collaborative skills, design thinking and creative investigation in order to create exciting and innovative games, be that for entertainment or social good. They also need structure and deadlines, and you can't learn that from YouTube. I am learning the Godot Game Engine via Youtube and some paid Kickstarter content however my process of thinking was transformed by Art School and I know this still positively affects me today. I don't think I can put it better than Douglas Rushkoff did in a recent [article](http://dctr.pro/2d0) so I am just going to quote from him here: \n\n>School (University) is a means of promoting not social control, or even productivity, but the higher value of learning itself. School (University) is less valuable for the information or skills transmitted than the mimesis — the live mirroring and modelling — through which students learn to think critically, develop rapport, and establish solidarity. School (University) is not directed at our utilitarian value, but our essential, intrinsic dignity. How profoundly sad it is that many of us think of a Harvard education more as a professional credential than a pinnacle of humanism.\n\nA [talk](https://youtu.be/IK5QDAhmAdQ) I attended later, from the designer of Knights and Bikes, was excellent and his Art School Education was clearly evident in the level of detail in the game and the way the game is likely to speak to players. His final slide of a death metal poster where one band clearly stood out was a call for game makers to be that band. To be different and to say something through games. The ‘indie’ panel discussion instead seemed focussed on playing it safe and balancing the cheque book. I believe strongly that this is likely to lead to uncreative and unimaginative games.\n\nI fundamentally believe we need games that speak to and from a diverse audience and this means taking risks and making projects that do not consider the bottom line or return on investment as the primary motivator. Indie game making is not, as the panel seemed to suggest, just to provide a route into the industry. \n\nIn my [final part](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/14/part-unlocking-the.html) I will discuss the real potential of indie games.\n",

In my work, I give talks on various game and design histories to my students each year, one of which ends with the title of this blog and is about a history of ‘indie’ games. I attribute the history of indie and other areas as starting much earlier than many realise. Within video games I suggest it starts in the 1960s with the PDP1 and Spacewar! made by a handful of engineers at MIT. This type of innovation in the ‘indie’ space continues up until today. I thus feel I have a good level of understanding around the history of ‘indie’ games. I also grew up on the ZX Spectrum (with the rubber keys!), the Amstrad CPC and the Amiga 500 before going to Art School to study Animation.

This decimated a large part of the creative side of the industry for years to come. \n\nThe discussion, I hoped, would have been a broader view of the background to, and history of, indie games in the UK. In my work, I give talks on various game and design histories to my students each year, one of which ends with the title of this blog and is about a history of ‘indie’ games. I attribute the history of indie and other areas as starting much earlier than many realise. Within video games I suggest it starts in the 1960s with the PDP1 and Spacewar! made by a handful of engineers at MIT. This type of innovation in the ‘indie’ space continues up until today. I thus feel I have a good level of understanding around the history of ‘indie’ games. I also grew up on the ZX Spectrum (with the rubber keys!), the Amstrad CPC and the Amiga 500 before going to Art School to study Animation. I am also a big fan of open education, Creative Commons, open source & free software alongside indie and alternative music. \n\nIn the [next part](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/08/indie-games-are.html) of this blog, I will build on this understanding to argue that indie is still important, to argue that the value of games education was unfairly trivialised, and to consider developers motivations.\n",

Once that’s in place I can try and figure out a level layout for testing. As that will be all the core mechanics in place. Although I’ve not tried to connect my retro usb joystick 🕹 up yet which is part of the experience. \n\nBONUS: I could now have different axes with some being better at chopping but maybe due to weight slow player down (thats a extra option for complexity)\n\n[GitLab Code](https://gitlab.adamprocter.co.uk/adamprocter/treeproject)\n\nN.B All sprites are placeholders for now\n",

I worked on a digital humanities (PORTUS) project with John helping facilitate its design direction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-specific-skills-can-you-bring-to-the-fellowship-ie-web-development-subject-matter-expertise-research-etc-\">What specific skills can you bring to the fellowship? (ie: web development, subject matter expertise, research, etc) :</h2>\n<p>A broad range of design and CS skills. I can build apps both in Swift and Javascript. I have used C#, GDScript, PHP, GoLang, Ruby and numerous databases. I use design tools for making and thinking, including Adobe CS, Sketch, Marvel app and currently build with Vue.js and Snap.svg and RT databases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-proposal-what-is-project-you-would-like-to-pursue-during-your-fellowship\">Project proposal: What is project you would like to pursue during your fellowship?</h2>\n<p>My proposal is to create the platform and interface for a free software, decentralised, P2P, spatial hypertext tool deployable within creative education settings.The platform is designed to support a collaborative interface that grows and changes through human input. Most VLEs are rigid, static top down tools this is much more fluid, adaptable and driven by the community.</p>\n<p>The platform and interface is native to digital culture built on the open web, democratic, human driven, iterative and collaborative. A visualised and spatial network of connections and clusters provide an innovative, accessible and delightful way to create and decode data, empowering individuals to connect ideas and build knowledge within communities of practice. The purpose of the tool&rsquo;s design is to extend collaborative learning and communities of practice from the physical into the digital. The project I am proposing is within part of my PhD but ultimately extends into the final stages of the PhD.</p>\n<p>My ambition is not only building the platform and interface but with the backing of the Fellowship I will widen the scope and potential reach of the project itself.  The overall ambition of my PhD is to interrogate the Virtual Learning Environment specifically in teaching design education and critically examine current tech business models from Silicon Valley that are being applied to Education, especially that of data collection. To be able to do this I will build a community around the products and manifesto of the PhD and I believe the fellowship would greatly enhance and amplify this ambition. Two other UK HE courses have registered interest in the spatial interface concepts I have been researching and having Mozilla backing would give gravitas to such an engagement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We shape our tools and, thereafter, our tools shape us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fellowship would support creating and testing a series of prototypes and build the platform via UX feedback, user testing and technology deployment in a way that would not be possible through my own funding.  A key component is to create a truly open process, not just in terms of ensuring all the products are free software but that the process of discovery itself is open and creative commons licensed. The fellowship period would be a time to focus on community building, both in terms of technical contribution and userbase. The collaborative nature of creative work means sharing is one of the main principles embedded in the platform and the PhD both in terms of a GNU Affero General Public License and default Creative Commons licensing.</p>\n<p>The project is to build a community not just of testers but of makers and thinkers to contribute to the platform and its ambition to support a new creative knowledge building tool. This fellowship will quickly boost the level of impact. This project aims to fix the issue that the digital tools we currently use for design education are broken: they are a replication of the physical office, files and folders. Learning is a collaborative, shared endeavour already embedded in design studio based teaching, but this model doesn’t extend to the digital tools we have.

The web’s arrival ushered in a world where we could collaborate and connect people in ways that had not been imagined. This opened up the possibility for innovation in numerous fields. Projects such as Wikipedia clearly demonstrate the power of the web. The open web democratised many facets of society and asked us to question how our world would be governed and understood. Business models were flipped with new ways of thinking. Innovation appeared in attempts to help us navigate this new landscape and ever-growing wealth of information. Pioneers of the internet foresaw ways in which humans and computers would work together to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the planet yet what the web has become is now purely derived to serve these two issues.  Rather than enhancing humankind the web has become adtech; it is being funneled through the view of corporations and their need to sell ads. Facebook claim to use this method to provide free access to all and thus connect people and yet Facebook decides what you see and when. Google claims to organise the wealth of information and yet money drives fake news to the top of search results. We must build alternative tools on the open web that provide ways to connect people, gather knowledge and provide true democracy outside of this neoliberal approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-are-you-the-right-candidate-for-10-months-of-self-directed-study-describe-your-current-professional-arrangement\">Why are you the right candidate for 10 months of self-directed study?

If so, who and in what context?\nLaura Hilliger, Jess Klein and John Bevan. Doug sent me the call and recommended I apply. I worked on a digital humanities (PORTUS) project with John helping facilitate its design direction.\n\n## What specific skills can you bring to the fellowship? (ie: web development, subject matter expertise, research, etc) :\nA broad range of design and CS skills. I can build apps both in Swift and Javascript. I have used C#, GDScript, PHP, GoLang, Ruby and numerous databases. I use design tools for making and thinking, including Adobe CS, Sketch, Marvel app and currently build with Vue.js and Snap.svg and RT databases.\n\n## Project proposal: What is project you would like to pursue during your fellowship?\nMy proposal is to create the platform and interface for a free software, decentralised, P2P, spatial hypertext tool deployable within creative education settings.The platform is designed to support a collaborative interface that grows and changes through human input. Most VLEs are rigid, static top down tools this is much more fluid, adaptable and driven by the community. \n\nThe platform and interface is native to digital culture built on the open web, democratic, human driven, iterative and collaborative. A visualised and spatial network of connections and clusters provide an innovative, accessible and delightful way to create and decode data, empowering individuals to connect ideas and build knowledge within communities of practice. The purpose of the tool's design is to extend collaborative learning and communities of practice from the physical into the digital. The project I am proposing is within part of my PhD but ultimately extends into the final stages of the PhD.\n\nMy ambition is not only building the platform and interface but with the backing of the Fellowship I will widen the scope and potential reach of the project itself.  The overall ambition of my PhD is to interrogate the Virtual Learning Environment specifically in teaching design education and critically examine current tech business models from Silicon Valley that are being applied to Education, especially that of data collection. To be able to do this I will build a community around the products and manifesto of the PhD and I believe the fellowship would greatly enhance and amplify this ambition. Two other UK HE courses have registered interest in the spatial interface concepts I have been researching and having Mozilla backing would give gravitas to such an engagement. \n\n> We shape our tools and, thereafter, our tools shape us.\n\nThe fellowship would support creating and testing a series of prototypes and build the platform via UX feedback, user testing and technology deployment in a way that would not be possible through my own funding.  A key component is to create a truly open process, not just in terms of ensuring all the products are free software but that the process of discovery itself is open and creative commons licensed. The fellowship period would be a time to focus on community building, both in terms of technical contribution and userbase. The collaborative nature of creative work means sharing is one of the main principles embedded in the platform and the PhD both in terms of a GNU Affero General Public License and default Creative Commons licensing.\n\nThe project is to build a community not just of testers but of makers and thinkers to contribute to the platform and its ambition to support a new creative knowledge building tool. This fellowship will quickly boost the level of impact. This project aims to fix the issue that the digital tools we currently use for design education are broken: they are a replication of the physical office, files and folders. Learning is a collaborative, shared endeavour already embedded in design studio based teaching, but this model doesn’t extend to the digital tools we have. This results in digital personal learning network silos and digital repositories that provide little or no benefit to the best types of collaborative teaching and learning.\n\n> Conventional electronic documents were designed in the 1970s by well-funded conventional thinkers at Xerox PARC, who asked, “How can we imitate paper?\"\n\n## What do you consider to be the biggest threat to the open web in your area of expertise?

All of these actions, tracking, storing, saving with you knowing is to ensure they can better curate your timeline which is so you spend more time in the Facebook eco system itself, as the more time spent on Facebook the more targeted the advertising can be and the more money that an be charged for that adverts spot. For some people Facebook is the web.</p>\n<p>So every often I would cut back on direct Facebook interactions. I have Firefox on my Mac and iOS set to block all trackers and have Firefox Focus Blocker turn on for iOS Safari, I use 3rd parties for other browsers on Mac and iOS including <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/\">Ghostery</a> (although I now understand Ghostery sells data to advertisers) and<a href=\"https://2017.ind.ie/blog/better/\">ind.ie’s Better</a>. I also use <a href=\"http://1.1.1.1\">1.1.1.1</a> a privacy based DNS. I now only cross post my content to Facebook  and Twitter. All the content I produce is stored where I have control over the data and it will not get removed due to changes in Terms and Conditions. However Facebook and Twitter are still gathering my data due to cross posting. Occasionally Facebook considers my cross posts from Micro.blog as Spam.</p>\n<p>Instagram is currently the worst offender in that their API does not allow any cross posting from any another source than the official app. So I currently post from instagram and use <a href=\"https://ownyourgram.com/\">Ownyourgram</a> to cross post and thus store the original content in micro.blog. All my photos are also uploaded to iCloud and Flickr. Videos don’t cross post so I use an <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> workflow that save these direct to dropbox. Twitter has recently killed off 3rd party app <a href=\"http://apps-of-a-feather.com/\">integration</a>.  So you have to ask why would these free services continue to allow any 3rd party style integration going forward?</p>\n<p>Actively deleting accounts is hard to do. Being less active on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Whats App is relatively easy to do but deleting you account loses you access to your friends and is thus much harder. Facebook knows this. Its called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\">The Network Effect</a>. Personally Instagram is one of the hardest for me to be less active on as I use it for both for myself and promoting the Games course I run, however since changes to the timeline and the like <a href=\"https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2018/04/10/instagram-make-me.html\">anxiety</a> I have, I certainly will move away from the platform, I thought it would be hard with Twitter but that proved not to be the case.</p>\n<p>So I can recommend taking a look at some alternatives such as <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">micro.blog</a> (twitter) <a href=\"https://www.signal.org/\">Signal</a> (what’s app) and <a href=\"http://sunlit.io/\">Sunlit</a> (instagram). As for a closed group sharing platform beyond a messaging app this is a little trickier but a perhaps a private <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a> instance would be the way to go, although pretty tech heavy to setup. I know some <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader\">work</a> is being done by the awesome <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com\">Aaron Parecki </a> that could allow you bring private blogs together in his app called <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Monocle\">Monocle</a> which looks very interesting and could easily allow for small communities to come together in one space privately.</p>\n<p>Ill be slowly reducing my time on all services and will see how long I continue to syndicate to them, so please see my <a href=\"https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk\">blog</a> , follow me on <a href=\"http://micro.blog/adamprocter\">micro.blog</a> and start conversations with me on <a href=\"http://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk\">discourse</a>.</p>\n<p>I am pleased the idea of the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">indie web</a> has seen more focus by the wider web community in the last few  years, it makes total sense to me and I am glad things are finally starting to come together and may well help bring the web further away from the Silicon Valley data monetisation model.</p>\n",

Occasionally Facebook considers my cross posts from Micro.blog as Spam.\n\nInstagram is currently the worst offender in that their API does not allow any cross posting from any another source than the official app. So I currently post from instagram and use [Ownyourgram](https://ownyourgram.com/) to cross post and thus store the original content in micro.blog. All my photos are also uploaded to iCloud and Flickr. Videos don’t cross post so I use an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) workflow that save these direct to dropbox. Twitter has recently killed off 3rd party app [integration](http://apps-of-a-feather.com/).  So you have to ask why would these free services continue to allow any 3rd party style integration going forward?\n\nActively deleting accounts is hard to do. Being less active on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Whats App is relatively easy to do but deleting you account loses you access to your friends and is thus much harder. Facebook knows this. Its called [The Network Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). Personally Instagram is one of the hardest for me to be less active on as I use it for both for myself and promoting the Games course I run, however since changes to the timeline and the like [anxiety](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2018/04/10/instagram-make-me.html) I have, I certainly will move away from the platform, I thought it would be hard with Twitter but that proved not to be the case. \n\nSo I can recommend taking a look at some alternatives such as [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) (twitter) [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) (what’s app) and [Sunlit](http://sunlit.io/) (instagram). As for a closed group sharing platform beyond a messaging app this is a little trickier but a perhaps a private [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance would be the way to go, although pretty tech heavy to setup. I know some [work](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/03/12/17/building-an-indieweb-reader) is being done by the awesome [Aaron Parecki ](https://aaronparecki.com) that could allow you bring private blogs together in his app called [Monocle](https://indieweb.org/Monocle) which looks very interesting and could easily allow for small communities to come together in one space privately.\n\nIll be slowly reducing my time on all services and will see how long I continue to syndicate to them, so please see my [blog](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk) , follow me on [micro.blog](http://micro.blog/adamprocter) and start conversations with me on [discourse](http://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk).\n\nI am pleased the idea of the [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) has seen more focus by the wider web community in the last few  years, it makes total sense to me and I am glad things are finally starting to come together and may well help bring the web further away from the Silicon Valley data monetisation model.\n",

Interspersed with the fact through the web , blogs gave everyone a voice, and will do a little bit on twitter and political changes (Arab spring etc.) This is for context. \n\nI’ll then head back to advertising and peoples current views into the web and why indie web / micro.blog / POSSE / owning a domain is becoming important. Ill probably drag in recent Guardian and such articles on peoples concerns of Facebook. Ending with the fact that if you want to publish on the web which is probably the most **powerful** platform for communication on the planet. The need to understand the web is in a bad place right now and the status quo of Google, Facebook, Twitter is not good at all in this regard. And encourage them to check out micro.blog / indieweb…\n\nSo any resources / links / things the microblog community think I must mention, either in terms of tech or seminal moments. Feel free to comment on my connected [discourse topic](https://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk/t/re-rise-of-indie-web-microblogging/191) or reply on [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/adamprocter).  \n",
