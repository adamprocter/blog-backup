Getting out of the Conference was the hardest and certainly this is not a league I would relish a return too. However, we are the fairy tale. We own our club, our ground and have a stable sustainable base to build from especially since COVID-19 we have finally started to properly settled into our new stadium and all the benefits this brings.</p>\n<p>We have now doubled our gates (even after being relegated from League 1) and have started to put in place a much more professional layers of staffing to run the football side of operations, some may say we have been a bit slow in this regard and perhaps that is part of what has put us into a really poor end of this season. But I am feeling optimistic about next season and will welcome Wrexham to Plough Lane and let the media see the real fairy tale still in the making.</p>\n<p>Be interesting to see what happens with TikTok as Wrexhams sponsor as less useful being banned in the states and gov.uk.

So they would have to fight again to regain control. \n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2023/a2174f565f.jpg\" alt=\"Pitchero+English+Football+Pyramid+System+PH 2479174821\" title=\"Pitchero+English+Football+Pyramid+System+PH-2479174821.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"360\" /><figcaption>The National League (Conference) is the top tier of non-league, teams will often not be professional and players will likely have other jobs up until this point. AFC Wimbledon actually re-started in Level 09 having been a member of the Premier League (Level 01) as Wimbledon FC only 3 seasons before that.</figcaption>\n<figure>\n\n## Aside \nYou could argue Wimbledons rise back from the combined counties league (that’s 5 leagues lower than the conference) all the way to League 2 was also the fact that we had more money than most other clubs in each league as we progressed. Getting out of the Conference was the hardest and certainly this is not a league I would relish a return too. However, we are the fairy tale. We own our club, our ground and have a stable sustainable base to build from especially since COVID-19 we have finally started to properly settled into our new stadium and all the benefits this brings. \n\nWe have now doubled our gates (even after being relegated from League 1) and have started to put in place a much more professional layers of staffing to run the football side of operations, some may say we have been a bit slow in this regard and perhaps that is part of what has put us into a really poor end of this season. But I am feeling optimistic about next season and will welcome Wrexham to Plough Lane and let the media see the real fairy tale still in the making. \n\nBe interesting to see what happens with TikTok as Wrexhams sponsor as less useful being banned in the states and gov.uk. But that’s another post about terrible football sponsorship. \n",

It&rsquo;s productive to contemplate and find solidarity with the rest of the life on this planet. It is productive to just be, not consuming, just searching for acceptance from those who accept you as you are.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am sitting in the garden reading this, well I am sat in the shanty town style lobster shack looking over my garden swimming pool, yeah I know living the dream. I am enjoying the sun and slowly plodding through my SaneNews mailbox listening to a Zero 7 created radio Apple Music mix. The only distraction is my mother in law texting me to ask where I am and when will I sit with her and watch TV, she doesn’t appreciate why I really don’t like watching TV. Oh well she needs company. I told her 5 more minutes.

				"content_text": "Such a good newsletter from [@epilepticrabbit@mastodon.social](https://micro.blog/epilepticrabbit@mastodon.social)  this week\n\nThis quote from it is excellent;\n\n>It is productive to slow down, tend the garden and watch the bees. It's productive to contemplate and find solidarity with the rest of the life on this planet. It is productive to just be, not consuming, just searching for acceptance from those who accept you as you are.\n\nI am sitting in the garden reading this, well I am sat in the shanty town style lobster shack looking over my garden swimming pool, yeah I know living the dream. I am enjoying the sun and slowly plodding through my SaneNews mailbox listening to a Zero 7 created radio Apple Music mix. The only distraction is my mother in law texting me to ask where I am and when will I sit with her and watch TV, she doesn’t appreciate why I really don’t like watching TV. Oh well she needs company. I told her 5 more minutes.

Foundational skills for immediate employment but then Kent Walker senior vice president of global affairs at Google states;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In our own hiring, we will now treat these new career certificates as the equivalent of a four-year degree for related roles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The thing is those that started in UX design moved into these roles as they appeared, they had degrees in design, art or english. They adapted as the industry moved they used far more than foundational skills to negotiate changes. I&rsquo;ve been to talks from the games industry advocating the ‘fact’ you could learn to make a game via Google usually from individuals with degrees in English, philosophy, art or design even, and yet you don’t need a degree.  This tends to be a narrow-minded view of new courses, they somehow think that a course called Games Design is not a ‘proper' degree anyway and not the route into industry. The motivation is usually to accelerate people into current roles and lower costs.</p>\n<p>Now for sure if you want to work on Fortnite 2, or any version of any game you can see now. You could get up to speed in 6 months in one very thin aspect of game making say basic 3d modelling and you could possibly get a ground level role if the company recognises the credentials, your portfolio would be very limited. I am not confident this would actually work in practice mind.</p>\n<p>However if it does I am also confident your starting wage and positions would be much lower than one of my graduates and your progression in the industry would be much slower.</p>\n<p>Why can I say this, two fold, I have the data to back this up but also a degree programme is not teaching you how to do a job role.  And if it isn&rsquo;t obvious the ‘jobs’ are always changing and evolving. Some roles our graduates are in didn&rsquo;t exist 6 months ago.</p>\n<p>In teaching a degree programme, we have what I like to call a lens. In my instance our lens is game making, I think it&rsquo;s a pretty important lens for many reasons, which can be found elsewhere on my blog, or just ask me why games are the most important design medium of our time, however it is still a lens. So within that Lens we are helping students to undertake what is wrapped in the package often called Life Long Learning.</p>\n<p>Some of the items in that package include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Resilience</li>\n<li>Cooperation</li>\n<li>Co-creation</li>\n<li>Project management</li>\n<li>History</li>\n<li>Context</li>\n<li>Research</li>\n<li>Negotiation</li>\n<li>Future thinking</li>\n<li>Curiosity</li>\n<li>Failing</li>\n<li>Reflection</li>\n<li>Society</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alongside all of these and more is the design, writing, psychology and technical skills to manifest ideas through game making, which is another huge list. And when I talk about skills there is again a specific way to really learn skills, my ZX Spectrum skills dont serve me today but the way I understood them does.</p>\n<p>This is a holistic approach to learning and how to work within a complex evolving system (our world). We do this with 3 to 4 years of project based learning, industry and exchange placements, projects and internships. MIT refers to this rather neatly as the four Ps - Projects, Passion, Peers and Play.</p>\n<p>You just can&rsquo;t cover this type of approach in a 6 month programme, whose central pillar is to get you a job role. Yes perhaps those that progress from the 6 months (crash) course may in a company likely learn a lot of what I describe above on the job but would that the best place and of course you run the risk of being let go for any ‘mistakes’ you may make.</p>\n<p>Walker then pulls out a patriotic flag to tug at our heart strings;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need new, accessible job-training solutions &hellip; to help America recover and rebuild.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be misled these courses are Google training programmes for Google to drive down the wages of designers and engineers.</p>\n<p>These two lines are just nonsense;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Higher education has been ripe for disruption for a long time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and that Google’s move;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… has major potential to change the future of education and work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh Please !</p>\n<p>Yes short vocational courses have there place but let’s understand that properly and have a real discussion on how we need a decent mixed economy of education rather than the ongoing diatribe of Silicon Valley disruption.</p>\n<p>This next quote for me is dangerous;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember: Nowadays, it&rsquo;s all about skills. Not degrees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A degree is not about getting a job at Apple, Google or IBM per se. This is the ongoing fundamental miss-understanding of education. What Google have created is a training programme not an education.</p>\n<p>The world has some of the most unprecedented issues the human race has ever faced, what we don’t need is more of the same skills,  we actually need more curiosity &amp; creativity, and I know where this thrives, in Design, Art and Humanities education.</p>\n<p>(yes I used the same click bait title - sorry 🤪)</p>\n",

I am not confident this would actually work in practice mind.\n\nHowever if it does I am also confident your starting wage and positions would be much lower than one of my graduates and your progression in the industry would be much slower. \n\nWhy can I say this, two fold, I have the data to back this up but also a degree programme is not teaching you how to do a job role.  And if it isn't obvious the ‘jobs’ are always changing and evolving. Some roles our graduates are in didn't exist 6 months ago. \n\nIn teaching a degree programme, we have what I like to call a lens. In my instance our lens is game making, I think it's a pretty important lens for many reasons, which can be found elsewhere on my blog, or just ask me why games are the most important design medium of our time, however it is still a lens. So within that Lens we are helping students to undertake what is wrapped in the package often called Life Long Learning. \n\nSome of the items in that package include;\n\n- Resilience\n- Cooperation \n- Co-creation\n- Project management\n- History\n- Context\n- Research\n- Negotiation \n- Future thinking\n- Curiosity\n- Failing\n- Reflection\n- Society\n\nAlongside all of these and more is the design, writing, psychology and technical skills to manifest ideas through game making, which is another huge list. And when I talk about skills there is again a specific way to really learn skills, my ZX Spectrum skills dont serve me today but the way I understood them does.\n\nThis is a holistic approach to learning and how to work within a complex evolving system (our world). We do this with 3 to 4 years of project based learning, industry and exchange placements, projects and internships. MIT refers to this rather neatly as the four Ps - Projects, Passion, Peers and Play.\n\nYou just can't cover this type of approach in a 6 month programme, whose central pillar is to get you a job role. Yes perhaps those that progress from the 6 months (crash) course may in a company likely learn a lot of what I describe above on the job but would that the best place and of course you run the risk of being let go for any ‘mistakes’ you may make.\n\nWalker then pulls out a patriotic flag to tug at our heart strings;\n\n>We need new, accessible job-training solutions ... to help America recover and rebuild.\n\nDon't be misled these courses are Google training programmes for Google to drive down the wages of designers and engineers. \n\nThese two lines are just nonsense;\n\n>Higher education has been ripe for disruption for a long time \n\nand that Google’s move;\n\n>… has major potential to change the future of education and work.\n\nOh Please ! \n\nYes short vocational courses have there place but let’s understand that properly and have a real discussion on how we need a decent mixed economy of education rather than the ongoing diatribe of Silicon Valley disruption. \n\nThis next quote for me is dangerous;\n\n> Remember: Nowadays, it's all about skills. Not degrees.\n\nA degree is not about getting a job at Apple, Google or IBM per se. This is the ongoing fundamental miss-understanding of education. What Google have created is a training programme not an education. \n\nThe world has some of the most unprecedented issues the human race has ever faced, what we don’t need is more of the same skills,  we actually need more curiosity & creativity, and I know where this thrives, in Design, Art and Humanities education. \n\n(yes I used the same click bait title - sorry 🤪)\n",

At the start of this year the faculty suggested I could get a laptop as part of my PhD, although I am in faculty, and so I have a machine for work (MacBook Pro 2019) but I do also pay half my fees so I jumped at the chance at the potential for some other hardware. This wasnt quiet the case and I had to use some of my internal &ldquo;kick back&rdquo; funds to pay but after a long delay, however the machine arrived today. There was lots of reasons for the delay checking funding, covid etc but the big piece and the only reason I needed any additional hardware was the was also getting sign of to be able to install a Linux Distribution on University supplied hardware, I had to sign off that I would not want support and agreement for my webscience and design PhD supervisors that it was a legit request. University process is painful sometimes !</p>\n<p>Due to numerous aspects of my research work - open, ethical, inclusive and delightful. I had gotten to the point where needed to properly consider, understand and undertake development on the open platform of Linux and also I wanted to use Pop!_ OS which was a Linux distribution that looked to have been working on UX /UI for a while, Aral Balkan and Doug Belshaw had mentioned it a number of time. I had thus previously run Pop! on a VMware but I didn&rsquo;t really use it as it was a VM and I was already on my main machine running macOS.  I had attempted a simular approach with a USB-C SSD drive hooked to my mac but that didnt work. I knew I needed seperate hardware that I could use as a main machine to really test out.</p>\n<p>I had not asked for any specific hardware just something that would run the Pop! system. So today a Dell Latitude Intel i5 8th Gen 1.60GHz , 8GB ram, 500gb SSD, intel, Radeon 540X Series graphic 14&quot; laptop arrived at my house (we now have home delivery due to covid-19), I was in meetings most of the day so my wife took the parcel in. I messaged the IT team to check if I needed to do anything special to install another OS, this unfortunatly meant they had to come back and turn of the BIOS password, I couldnt even log into the system with the Universiry field machine set up anyway.</p>\n<p>Ok with the BIOS disabled I used Etcher.io to put the live OS onto a USB stick, this was hurdle one as my mac had not been set to allow this app to have the right level permissions to mount and unmount disks, I ended up running the App via sudo from terminal which forced the issue, I suspect I could have just edited security settings in Preferences but the error was not very clear it was a permission issue. The writer process has quit unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>Once permissions where updated the USB stick was ready. I plugged this in to the Dell and duck duck go searched USB boot Dell to find out how to chooise a boot device, which advised pressing f12, the Pop! website had I read on said laptops would use f1 or f7, which was not the case. f12 worked but I checked this twice as to make sure I was seeing the USB device as it appeared twice in the list. So I selected the USB stick and it restarted followed by small white text on the background which said &ldquo;You need to load the kernel first&rdquo; and nothing happened. I searched this error and it seemed I needed to turn of secure boot, I had seen this was on previously. I was happy to edit the bios settings and so disabled secure boot, which did also sent me on a bit of a deadend reboot once when it tried to restarted into the pre installed windows, this was not allowed and I entered something called BitRecovery.

I was concerned my GPU was prehaps not supported, and there was a lot of talk about rufus mode (no idea). I then found a post that had another line that advised when you see the visual test and install Pop prompt you should press the letter e and the following line should say gfxpayload=text.

We must work to combat this stereotyping.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Guardian is an excellent example of opposition to this with Games featured under <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Culture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and not under entertainment or toys for example.</p>\n<p>So we know there is diverse audience and diverse players but those working in the “Games industry” are still predominantly white men. The workforce in the UK identifies as 28% female and 20% worldwide. This is a complex and multi-faceted issue but is in part due to the wider issue of Technology, Engineering and Computer Science having the same issues.  Some of the historical context of this largely lies around the marketing of technology in the 1980s with a focus on these things being for boys and we know that Schools and marketing still skew that interest in technology.</p>\n<p>A great example of a product that is already combating this within Engineering and girls is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoldieBlox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the argument that there is any biological difference is factually incorrect, data from across the world in fact shows girls out performing boys in science tests in fact, and yet there interest in the Science Technology Engineering and maths (STEM) subjects drops at around 15 years old and never recovers.</p>\n<p>GoldieBlox uses storytelling with STEM principles as extensive testing with girls showed this type of interaction appealed much more to girls than for example Lego&rsquo;s attempts in this regard by just making the boxes pink.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The voices of many people are needed to create great and compelling Games for all people and the powerful potential of Games to unite people can only be unlocked if we have a diverse representation of people making these products. Why would any industry not want to have diversity?</p>\n<p>Can we make it change? The stats are already showing a rise of diversity in the Games industries themselves and in the diversity of makers but there is much work to be done which starts at Schools and Universities. This includes educating against discrimination, encouraging participation and showcasing role models.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>From the inception of the course at WSA we knew based on the industry and are position, we wanted to and where in a place to encourage diversity into making Games. We understood the power Games would have and where Games where heading, although already a huge industry in 2013, the direction of future travel was very exciting, we are really only just seeing the impact of this exciting medium. The V&amp;A in 2019 called Games design one of the most significant design fields of our time.</p>\n<p>Connected to this concept we knew and had working knowledge of the game engine Unity. The engine was well established and was well on its way to achieve its goal of democratising game making.</p>\n<p>It had been doing this as its focus was on creativity, it has an editor that was powerful yet visual and including things such as simple drag and drop capabilities, this meant many more people could just start to quickly realise an idea without a focus on the technology. Unity is all about bringing ideas to life, without a focus on how great the technology is but a focus on enabling creativity. Something like Media Molecules Dreams is probably the next phase in the arena of what has been coined in the past as Game 3.0.</p>\n<p>Also having taught coding and interaction design skills to students within an Art School for well over 10 years I was also acutely aware of how off putting coding can be for anyone who wants to be creative, it can be very stifling, and a barrier to entry. This is often because of a focus on the technology rather than the manifestation of the idea or intent through the use of appropriate media.</p>\n<p>I had personally seen with my background in interaction design, the alienation of women, at events and online and I have 3 daughters whom I encouraged to do whatever they were passionate about yet saw and heard discouraging comments around what is for girls and what is for boys.</p>\n<p>With all this in mind we developed a course that uses design thinking and making through the lens of Games to tell stories, provide emotional moments and more. We didn’t focus on technology and we didn’t focus on only video Games, we focussed on research, ideas and manifesting them in game artefacts.</p>\n<p>We knew this would draw diverse people to the course, also by situating our course within WSA, the University of Southampton’s Art School and not within the Computer Science Faculty we could really push the way we teach Games and the approach of what Games are. These opportunities allowed the creation of a unique course of study situated within Games.</p>\n<p>What we do in our course is some simple but deliberate things, we make very sure all our decisions include diversity. And so we look to feature that diversity by making active and conscious design choices with any of our processes and outputs to ensure there is diverse representation. Students work in teams and we mix them up for each project, considering their background alongside their current skillsets.</p>\n<p>We as a team of staff and of our students are also made aware of the unconscious bias that can creep into our every day life and so we take deliberate actions to combat this. This can be as simple as adapting the language we use. We make sure all of our text is gender neutral and we actively seek out and test this with our students, even this blog post was discussed with our current year 3 students to see if this was accurate and agreeable to them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>At open days and interview days we ensure a diversity of students are represented from Games on campus. This we know that has a direct impacts on ensuring diverse recruitment, students have stated that this is what enabled them to see themselves at WSA studying Games, because they see someone like them. This is often coupled with the realisation they have every right to want to make Games as anyone else.</p>\n<p>We are careful to pick media and outputs that do not reinforce the stereotypical idea of Games, for example our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->course film<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has conscious efforts to showcase diversity. All of our open day and external talks mention and talk about diversity in Games, and we select Games that people may not have heard of and talk about the why of the Games more than the how. These actions we know has direct impact on our recruitment diversity. We have always had a close affiliation with Women in Games UK and Vanissa our year one tutor is an ambassador, alongside a number of Alumni winning Women in Games Awards. We then make sure we promote these types of activities and awards on our social media and websites.</p>\n<p>Each year we make sure to invite a diverse range of speakers to provide guest input into the course, with an active part of their day spent talking to students about their own experiences and discussion the students own projects, this adds to feeling part of a real community. For example over the last year we have had guests including, Minkette an Escape room designer, Emma Reay a researcher looking at Games scholarship and children&rsquo;s literature scholarship and Lucy Kyriakidou a freelance 2d game artist.  We think about every choice we make to showcase diversity and this in turn combats the issue of diversity in Games. Showing role models and inspirational people. We want to create a course that is inclusive as we know that there are many artists and designers that want to use the medium of Games to inspire and enrich others, just as it has for them and we want to show that this is possible and that there is a way in.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>A key is to write projects that will have broad appeal and provide excellent learning, so we create and encourage projects within our modules that talk to or are about themes and ideas, not about the technology or the skills directly. We then embed as necessary technology and skills within the thinking and research but the driver is not the technology. This appeals to designers and artists from different backgrounds and is less intimidating for anyone than say a bunch of technology jargon or buzzwords. As an example you could have a project on Virtual Reality (VR) or instead you could have a project that looks at why humans have been obsessed with the idea of immersion since the Victorians. One offers a narrow view and uses technology that lots of women see as horribly designed and not designed for them, the other offers opportunities to consider VR from many points of view, both projects would culminate in a VR experience but the differences would be dramatic.  We know many young girls are playing Games and have a love for Games and so we want to show that not only can they consume these Games but they could be making them, this is the only way we address and bring diversity to the Games industries.</p>\n<p>The effects of this work have been measured in our recruitment which is very different to the vast majority of institutes that currently offer Games course;</p>\n<p>For context\nFemale percentage in current cohort;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Female percentage of our Alumni graduates;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Across the University of Southampton a lot of good work being done generally to encourage women into STEAM (A for Art). We have the Women in Science and Technology + group, which now crosses into humanities and runs many cross faculty projects. We have specific competitions that call for participation from underrepresented groups, alongside celebrating and connecting our work to days that celebrate role models such as Ada Lovelace. One year on International Women’s day, I arrived at WSA to find the Games studio walls plastered with images of women from the Games industry with quotes about their achievements, we never took them down. The University is active in upholding the standards of the Athena Swan charter and is a member of the race and equality charter.  The Games industry is generally very welcoming and supportive of diversity and is a welcoming community and is general fully committed to addressing the issue of diversity, and so we do see positive change, with a growth in the number of women in Games, it is probably too slow but it is growing.</p>\n<p>All of the above has to be done as an active consideration of what you do, there is an issue with diversity in Games and this is not ok. The UK Games industry needs to do much more work to fund and support diverse game making, for an industry worth more than music and film combined (globally) it should do more in this regard, I would like to see nationwide schemes to provide funding to more of the indie makers, there are still to many stories of how great game makers had to work numerous jobs to fund Games that have huge value to society. On a smaller scale Games companies and educators should consider everything they do from how you design your studio space, how you write you course curriculum and how you promote your activities.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself does this have the potential to feed a stereotype, if so stop and change what it is. Games are for every player and so we need makers of every type. Promote diversity wherever possible, as the male dominated position has had enough promotion.</p>\n",

We have specific competitions that call for participation from underrepresented groups, alongside celebrating and connecting our work to days that celebrate role models such as Ada Lovelace. One year on International Women’s day, I arrived at WSA to find the Games studio walls plastered with images of women from the Games industry with quotes about their achievements, we never took them down. The University is active in upholding the standards of the Athena Swan charter and is a member of the race and equality charter.  The Games industry is generally very welcoming and supportive of diversity and is a welcoming community and is general fully committed to addressing the issue of diversity, and so we do see positive change, with a growth in the number of women in Games, it is probably too slow but it is growing.\n \nAll of the above has to be done as an active consideration of what you do, there is an issue with diversity in Games and this is not ok. The UK Games industry needs to do much more work to fund and support diverse game making, for an industry worth more than music and film combined (globally) it should do more in this regard, I would like to see nationwide schemes to provide funding to more of the indie makers, there are still to many stories of how great game makers had to work numerous jobs to fund Games that have huge value to society. On a smaller scale Games companies and educators should consider everything they do from how you design your studio space, how you write you course curriculum and how you promote your activities.  \n\nAsk yourself does this have the potential to feed a stereotype, if so stop and change what it is. Games are for every player and so we need makers of every type. Promote diversity wherever possible, as the male dominated position has had enough promotion.\n",

I’ve been fortunate enough to attend and participate in a number of Women in Games events but I have to say the conference this year was of the highest quality. The selection of speakers and panel guests were fantastic. Do look <a href=\"https://womeningamesconference.co.uk/\">them all up</a> and catch some of the recorded talks on <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/wigj/profile\">twitch</a> if you can.</p>\n<p>It also solidified in my mind a rising issue that I have not really been able to stop thinking about since EGX Rezzed in <a href=\"https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html\">April</a>. This relates to the mismatching between funding and funds.

				"content_text": "This week I was able to attend day one of the latest European Women in Games Conference. What an awesome day. I’ve been fortunate enough to attend and participate in a number of Women in Games events but I have to say the conference this year was of the highest quality. The selection of speakers and panel guests were fantastic. Do look [them all up](https://womeningamesconference.co.uk/) and catch some of the recorded talks on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wigj/profile) if you can. \n\nIt also solidified in my mind a rising issue that I have not really been able to stop thinking about since EGX Rezzed in [April](https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html). This relates to the mismatching between funding and funds. But also what needs to be funded. \n\nI am confident individuals on the panels could have helped and so I want to try and connect to a number of them again. However I didn't pose questions at the event as who needs to hear from another privileged white male in that setting. More voices needed to express themselves at the event and I enjoyed every question and comment. \n\nI do however want to move this concern of mine forward over the next year and will need help and support to do so. \n\nSo what am I talking about I hear you cry!?\n\nThe issue is why are \"the Games industry\" and the UK government not properly funding independent gaming making?\n\nThe data is clear: games and interactive experiences are able to create positive impact and behavioural change in ways that outstrip other media and outreach activities. \n\nGames are proven to be more powerful than film and music in engaging people in empathy, understanding and compassion. \n\nGames enable marginalised communities to tell their story in ways that bridge the gaps between people and communities. \n\nThis is coupled with the fact that our world faces challenges it has never seen before that truly require people to be united in order to make progress. \n\nYet every one of the makers that have realised that they can have this type of impact, raised concerns on funding, not just for the project itself but just to pay the bills. They often resign themselves to the fact that this is the life of an “Artist”. This is often coupled with a realisation that the large games companies fail to take risks and just back the same titles again and again. \n\nThe games industry is the biggest entertainment industry on the planet. The money in the games industry is huge. \n\nThe Planet needs people to make big changes in the way they engage with the environment and each other. \n\nSo it's appears we have found a medium that can right now be a huge force for positive change. We have games companies making massive  profits. Yet the creators that could lead the way in this are struggling to pay their household bills. \n\nThis is at least a missed opportunity and at worst a gross injustice given the clear need right now for global change. \n\nGames can change the world so why are we not funding the heck out of independent game makers?\n\nI thus think we need to raise awareness of the need for funding and lobby governments and companies to urgently fund diverse game making. \n\nI have some ideas on where we could  start but need to do some more thinking about this and more importantly do this thinking with others. \n\nLet me know what you think and if you would like to get involved via this forum link. [discourse.adamprocter.co.uk](https://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk/t/game-makers-unite/314)\n\nMy own initial quick ideas :\n\n- Game makers need to know about all the funding that they could access across the creative industries.\n- Game makers need to have the up to date research and data on how games are and can have huge impact to support gaining funding. \n- Game makers need a place network to discuss and share resources to support indie game making. \n- Supporting a Sustainable diverse game maker community is really important. \n- Return on Investment is not the only  and possibly not the best way to measure success. \n",

				"title": "Surveillance for mental health conditions in Higher Education",
				"content_html": "<p>Firstly and correctly mental health is a big issue and something I care deeply about, having seen mental health issues rising in Universities year on year, having friends that suffer with mental health issues and occasionally doubting my own mental health with work and family pressures, not to mention when that imposter syndrome kicks in, we have to get better at supporting and helping to tackle mental health. As one of the two undergraduate Senior Personal Academic tutors at Winchester School of Art I am also exposed to a lot more of these issues, so I know we need action. However the surveillance of students is not the way to solve this issue. As many reading this blog you will know one of my long term concerns has been the potential infectious nature that Silicon Valleys Big data model could have on education. So I am opposed to the project just announced by Northumbria University.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A £2m project supported by the OfS will use innovative integration of technology, advanced educational data analytics, student relationship management and student support to provide an understanding of the opportunities to predict whether a student is already experiencing or will have a mental health crisis. (<a href=\"https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/northumbria-university-to-lead-transformation-in-how-the-higher-education-sector/\">2019</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This project is backed by the OfS, the OfS are an independent public body they are not part of central Government, but they have to report to Parliament through the Department for Education (DfE).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We want every student to have a fulfilling experience of higher education that enriches their lives and careers. (<a href=\"https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/about/our-strategy/\">2019</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They have a nice diagram of how they plan to achieve this goal. Concerning for me is the foundation stone appears to be &ldquo;value for money&rdquo;. I do not see much detail on how the OfS define value for money but in much of the press there has been too much emphasis on return on investment and the pure utilitarian view of higher education.

				"content_text": "Firstly and correctly mental health is a big issue and something I care deeply about, having seen mental health issues rising in Universities year on year, having friends that suffer with mental health issues and occasionally doubting my own mental health with work and family pressures, not to mention when that imposter syndrome kicks in, we have to get better at supporting and helping to tackle mental health. As one of the two undergraduate Senior Personal Academic tutors at Winchester School of Art I am also exposed to a lot more of these issues, so I know we need action. However the surveillance of students is not the way to solve this issue. As many reading this blog you will know one of my long term concerns has been the potential infectious nature that Silicon Valleys Big data model could have on education. So I am opposed to the project just announced by Northumbria University.\n\n> A £2m project supported by the OfS will use innovative integration of technology, advanced educational data analytics, student relationship management and student support to provide an understanding of the opportunities to predict whether a student is already experiencing or will have a mental health crisis. ([2019](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/northumbria-university-to-lead-transformation-in-how-the-higher-education-sector/))\n\nThis project is backed by the OfS, the OfS are an independent public body they are not part of central Government, but they have to report to Parliament through the Department for Education (DfE).\n\n> We want every student to have a fulfilling experience of higher education that enriches their lives and careers. ([2019](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/about/our-strategy/))\n\nThey have a nice diagram of how they plan to achieve this goal. Concerning for me is the foundation stone appears to be \"value for money\". I do not see much detail on how the OfS define value for money but in much of the press there has been too much emphasis on return on investment and the pure utilitarian view of higher education.  Measuring your degree against your future incoming is a very simplistic and poor metric. \n\nIn this mental health technology project the main technology partner is Civitas Learning International. They do seem to sell products but you have to question their business model, following round after round of Venture Capital funding I cannot but suspect these backers will want to ensure the technology pays them back.  Civitas are a for profit company after all.\n\nHere is a quick list of their Funding announcements over the last few years;\n\n- [$60 Million ](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/28/civitas-learning-gets-60-million-commitment-from-warburg-pincus/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_cs=XQI4EfKi6SIl5jJYVdtDdg)\n- [$16 Million](https://www.civitaslearning.com/press/civitas-learning-closes-16-million-in-funding-to-continue-trailblazing-efforts-in-data-science-and-student-success/)\n- [$8million](http://newmarketsvp.com/2013/06/20/civitas-learning-closes-8-75-million-in-funding-to-achieve-big-goals-with-big-data-in-higher-education/)\n- [Crunchbase details](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/civitas-learning#section-investors) \n\nIn the middle of this funding they 'had to' lay off 10% of staff as well, note the reason. \n\n>last week that the layoffs were part of a “strategic shift” that “forced Civitas to let go of some talent and post new jobs for positions better suited for the company’s future” in personalized pathways and predictive analytics offerings.(2017)\n\nPredictive analytics. Zuboff shows us clearly in The Age of Surveillance (2019) that prediction is the key piece to manipulate and modify human behaviour for capitalist gains. \n\nCivitas again laid off more staff at the start of this year (2019) and again this was shortly after more funding ([EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-02-27-another-investment-another-round-of-layoffs-for-civitas-learning)) Plus there is certainly a lot of negative reviews on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Civitas-Learning-RVW18170194.htm).\n\nI do not see any good actors in this project at this stage.  \n\nCould this £2million have been spent differently to support mental health within Universities I have a strong sense it could have been.  I'll watch this project with concerned Interest. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2019/f61967458e.jpg\" width=\"551\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n",

Indie game making is not, as the Rezzed panel seemed to suggest, just to provide a route into the industry.</p>\n<p>Games are huge. Games are the biggest entertainment medium on the planet. This provides a massive audience with diverse tastes. And this is a massive audience that can be spoken to.

The ‘indie’ panel discussion focus on skills, money, business planning and ‘what the ‘industry’ wants’ does little to encourage or ensure that there continues to be a diverse community of makers, lead not just by white men, money, and publishers that have “made it”.</p>\n<p>We should note as well that the industry at one end has unstable employment, developer burn out and more games being made by contracting ‘teams’. While those making ‘indie’ games need to have a day job to support themselves and ensure they have the business acumen to go cap in hand to the publishers, who are not disposed to take risks. Where is the investment in new companies and creative start-ups?</p>\n<p>There was some brief discussion on trickle down payment streaming services: making games that are twitchable or supporting games via services such as the Venture Capital (VC) backed Patreon. Although none of these options where discussed in much depth and the discussion was connected to looking at other industries that have seen change via digital disruption, specifically pointing to the music industry. The picture painted was that Games would move towards a market of the Beyoncé’s and the artists living off Bandcamp or subsidiary sales such as merchandise to sustain making ‘indie’ games. What a dividing and terrible situation. The Music industry is not in a good place. This is not a sustainable future I would want for games. So why not think differently? Why doesn&rsquo;t UKIE lobby companies and governments to invest in these creative endeavours? The panel touched on mid-size companies folding or closing down and connected this to bad business, but I suspect this is a very simplistic view of the situation and again likely more related to demands for return on investment and VC exits.</p>\n<p>Itch.io continues to be very interesting. Why not invest in a space for UK makers within itch.io? Perhaps UKIE already do? Why not look at the model of investment in the Arts in Canada? The UK games tax break is good, but the ability for only match funding schemes in the UK is very poor. A later panel on running a games studio asked for game makers to show products that shipped in their portfolios if they wanted to get selected to work on the contracted team within bigger products. How about supporting individuals to do this? That could be a very productive approach to ‘routes into the industry’.</p>\n<p>Apple Arcade, for which I have positive thoughts, was also rolled out as one of the new Netflix style models for games. Yet all the companies showcased so far are well established and I do not yet see details of how Apple Arcade would support new initiatives. Will they still be left hidden in the ‘free to play’ wasteland? Have Apple hired a bunch of new individuals to even source and select great games? Should UKIE look for ways to support creatives to get onto this platform directly?</p>\n<p>Sony have been incubating game teams and projects for decades and really understand games. Yet we don&rsquo;t see Sony backing the types of risks much in recent years. E3 for example in the last 2-3 years in terms of showcasing small projects in the keynote has been particularly poor. A quick comparison of Sony over recent years shows a marked difference. Journey was delayed, over budget and yet Sony took the risk and kept faith in the team, adjusted schedules and injected money. No Man’s Sky, which is now winning awards and much delayed praise, was released - it appears - under pressure from Sony and in doing so damaged the team and the game. Yet it seems many of the things Sean Murray, owner of Hello Games, mentioned and was accused of tricking players into purchasing or over promising, now appear in the game after 2 more years of development. Hello Games have also announced a Hello Games Short.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Hello Games Short. Like Pixar shorts it’s a way to foster creativity and new voices in the studio.

The few games the panel held up as indie included The Cultist Simulator which cost £140k+ to produce and Monument Valley which had nearly £2million in initial investment. In a year in which UKIE released stats showing a record spend on games in the UK where is this money going? Where could a new game maker or makers get access to this type investment, if this is what’s needed to make any game for market? Thus, the discussion ended up revolving mainly around how even indie game makers must become business savvy.</p>\n<p>The panel mentioned Unity 3d (2005) and Unity’s position and claim to have helped democratise game making - which I agree with. When Unity came out it was a moment when I also thought ‘Wow - this will be how creatives and artists could start to speak via games’, and they did. However, I have to note that at the time, most of the ‘industry’ laughed at the release during Apples WWDC in 2005. “You can&rsquo;t make games on macOS” was the cry. And only a few years ago another educator tried to belittle me and our choice to use Unity as our main engine, when in general conversation they advised me “you know that’s not industry standard”. The thoughts of what education is for also echoed in my mind at this point and it’s certainly not to teach Unity or Unreal.</p>\n<p>The Graveyard (Belgium, 2009) is a fantastic example of what Unity could and would go on to do. Yet how can the so-called budget requirements mentioned support ongoing democratisation?</p>\n<p>In 2008 the UK based Media Molecule released Little Big Planet and Sony talked about Game 3.0. Games that would allow players to be creators; consumers could become creators. We are now closer than ever to realising Game 3.0. In fact, a decade later, a recent Edge (March 2018) article nodded towards this and got me excited again. But this can only happen if we encourage creatives to use these tools and not be concerned with the commercial potential of their ideas. It is clear that Media Molecules Dreams is this type of Game 3.0 tool.</p>\n<p>I have since spoken to some of the Media Molecule team and asked directly about paid content creation, which although currently is not an option, it is something they have thought about and very much see the value of paying creators. So we as artists and designers need to push developers such as Media Molecule, to not take advantage of free content producers. Those companies that start to pioneer in this emerging Game 3.0 field will no doubt draw more talent to the industry, with possibly interesting and sustainable business models for content creators. I will touch on the concepts of monetisation the panel nodded towards in my third post, but you may have guessed I didn’t agree with the panel’s thoughts on parallels towards following the music industry.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the panel discussion, one piece of advice was to not waste money on a Games Development course at University, and the suggestion that you can learn Games Development via a Google search. The panel were heard to laugh in agreement at this statement. Now I am a huge advocate of open education resources and I once learnt how to fix a problem with part of my car on YouTube; however, that doesn&rsquo;t make me a mechanic and I wouldn&rsquo;t advocate all mechanics should learn their trade on YouTube. Throw-away comments such as these, and other concerning trends, see people like Peter Thiel offering $100k “to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom”. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of education.</p>\n<p>I believe each panel member had a degree, albeit not in games, so I must assume they do in fact value the usefulness of higher education. In view of this, perhaps the wording of the statement should have been more carefully selected, or otherwise qualified, rather than being diminishing and dismissive. The benefit of working cooperatively with educators is much more useful than bashing them. Universities offer much more than skills.</p>\n<p>If we agree that the way to solve some of the most complex problems is through creative thinking, then I am confident Universities offer this space through a variety of subjects. And I happen to think Games is a very strong area in which to apply this type of thinking.</p>\n<p>Young people need to build confidence, collaborative skills, design thinking and creative investigation in order to create exciting and innovative games, be that for entertainment or social good. They also need structure and deadlines, and you can&rsquo;t learn that from YouTube.

Games are an art form that can comment on society and fulfil the function of art. So, I hold games in a very high regard.

Rather than a conventional talk, it came in the format of a panel discussion that was recorded as a podcast (and can be heard <a href=\"https://30yearsofplay.uk/podcast/30yearsofindie\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>As the panel discussion drew to a close the question, I was formulating was something along the lines of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the start of this talk you alluded to the UK indie scene starting more than 30 years ago in the games of Matthew Smith and Jeff Minter. It is a fact that this type of game making and creativity was gone or pushed to the fringes when money, the marketeers and publishers took over. UKIE have just reported the biggest spend on video games in the UK and yet the titles you mentioned now as ‘indie’: Cultist, £140k to make; Monument Valley somewhere in the region of £2m to make.

And thus encourage more ad driven and in app games in this space ?\n\nDoes the game have to work on all platforms from day one of release?\n\nI’m sure I’ll think of more as the time goes on and as we find out more. Not being a Google fan and wanting games that are different, games as an art form and games as cultural artifacts, this certainly appeals more than Stadia to me as a player and designer. Of course I expect I’ll subscribe on day one. \n\nASIDE: So can we now expect Apple to actually make a decent controller for Apple TV... but then again if Apple Arcade is all platforms that has a big limit on special capabilities so I guess a controller for all devices is coming. 👾\n",

(ie: web development, subject matter expertise, research, etc) :</h2>\n<p>A broad range of design and CS skills. I can build apps both in Swift and Javascript. I have used C#, GDScript, PHP, GoLang, Ruby and numerous databases. I use design tools for making and thinking, including Adobe CS, Sketch, Marvel app and currently build with Vue.js and Snap.svg and RT databases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-proposal-what-is-project-you-would-like-to-pursue-during-your-fellowship\">Project proposal: What is project you would like to pursue during your fellowship?</h2>\n<p>My proposal is to create the platform and interface for a free software, decentralised, P2P, spatial hypertext tool deployable within creative education settings.The platform is designed to support a collaborative interface that grows and changes through human input. Most VLEs are rigid, static top down tools this is much more fluid, adaptable and driven by the community.</p>\n<p>The platform and interface is native to digital culture built on the open web, democratic, human driven, iterative and collaborative. A visualised and spatial network of connections and clusters provide an innovative, accessible and delightful way to create and decode data, empowering individuals to connect ideas and build knowledge within communities of practice. The purpose of the tool&rsquo;s design is to extend collaborative learning and communities of practice from the physical into the digital. The project I am proposing is within part of my PhD but ultimately extends into the final stages of the PhD.</p>\n<p>My ambition is not only building the platform and interface but with the backing of the Fellowship I will widen the scope and potential reach of the project itself.  The overall ambition of my PhD is to interrogate the Virtual Learning Environment specifically in teaching design education and critically examine current tech business models from Silicon Valley that are being applied to Education, especially that of data collection. To be able to do this I will build a community around the products and manifesto of the PhD and I believe the fellowship would greatly enhance and amplify this ambition. Two other UK HE courses have registered interest in the spatial interface concepts I have been researching and having Mozilla backing would give gravitas to such an engagement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We shape our tools and, thereafter, our tools shape us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fellowship would support creating and testing a series of prototypes and build the platform via UX feedback, user testing and technology deployment in a way that would not be possible through my own funding.  A key component is to create a truly open process, not just in terms of ensuring all the products are free software but that the process of discovery itself is open and creative commons licensed. The fellowship period would be a time to focus on community building, both in terms of technical contribution and userbase. The collaborative nature of creative work means sharing is one of the main principles embedded in the platform and the PhD both in terms of a GNU Affero General Public License and default Creative Commons licensing.</p>\n<p>The project is to build a community not just of testers but of makers and thinkers to contribute to the platform and its ambition to support a new creative knowledge building tool. This fellowship will quickly boost the level of impact. This project aims to fix the issue that the digital tools we currently use for design education are broken: they are a replication of the physical office, files and folders. Learning is a collaborative, shared endeavour already embedded in design studio based teaching, but this model doesn’t extend to the digital tools we have. This results in digital personal learning network silos and digital repositories that provide little or no benefit to the best types of collaborative teaching and learning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conventional electronic documents were designed in the 1970s by well-funded conventional thinkers at Xerox PARC, who asked, “How can we imitate paper?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-you-consider-to-be-the-biggest-threat-to-the-open-web-in-your-area-of-expertise-why-in-what-way-would-the-internet----or-the-world----be-different-if-this-threat-were-mitigated\">What do you consider to be the biggest threat to the open web in your area of expertise?

We now live in an attention-based economy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These two concerns are intrinsically connected. The need to keep our attention is being transformed by the surveillance of our data. The web’s arrival ushered in a world where we could collaborate and connect people in ways that had not been imagined. This opened up the possibility for innovation in numerous fields. Projects such as Wikipedia clearly demonstrate the power of the web. The open web democratised many facets of society and asked us to question how our world would be governed and understood. Business models were flipped with new ways of thinking. Innovation appeared in attempts to help us navigate this new landscape and ever-growing wealth of information. Pioneers of the internet foresaw ways in which humans and computers would work together to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the planet yet what the web has become is now purely derived to serve these two issues.  Rather than enhancing humankind the web has become adtech; it is being funneled through the view of corporations and their need to sell ads. Facebook claim to use this method to provide free access to all and thus connect people and yet Facebook decides what you see and when. Google claims to organise the wealth of information and yet money drives fake news to the top of search results. We must build alternative tools on the open web that provide ways to connect people, gather knowledge and provide true democracy outside of this neoliberal approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-are-you-the-right-candidate-for-10-months-of-self-directed-study-describe-your-current-professional-arrangement\">Why are you the right candidate for 10 months of self-directed study?

Awesome interview with Tim Schafer maker of some of my favourite games. Monkey Island, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango and publishing some amazing new Games such as Knights and Bikes<br /><br /> The Leftfield room has some really interesting games, rock paper shotgun room had some great fun and custom controller games. One on which a friend can literally adjust variables in the game such as zoom level and speed ! Was hilarious. Both bigger indie rooms also awesome. The Unreal room was not my cuppa tea and continued to reenforce my feelings that unreal isn’t an indie dev engine really. Meet some Godot Fans too 😄👍\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Any of my “followers” will be acutely aware that I have been going on about privacy and the invasion of this by corporate Silicon Valley for a little while now.  Their albeit legal but unethical use of data mining has become the sole business model of the vast majority of internet technologies we use. Yet I have accounts on almost all of the services, my wife would say;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get out, leave us alone and shut the door behind you..In fact she has numerous times. We only recently refriended on Facebook.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was I have to admit an addict to signing up to any new internet service which is why I have accounts nearly everywhere, back in the early days of the web this was pretty exciting and something I felt compelled to do. Also it was the one way to secure that precious username, some accounts lay very dormant and some I still use more regularly.</p>\n<p>One such service is Facebook, over the years friends and family have slowly joined Facebook. My many attempts prior to this to try and get family to consider sharing online was well met normally with “why would I want to do that” Even robust and Friendly cross platform private services such as Flickr or such never worked, the technical barriers albeit low still were still to high, it was only for the nerds, of course this did change not rapidly but slowly. So to be fair it is nice to see more images, comments and links from family and friends via Facebook.</p>\n<p>Over time Facebook adjusted its timeline and went from a chronological based timeline to an algorithmic timeline, in fact all the popular social network services have ended up doing this, there has been some <a href=\"http://thoughtshrapnel.com/2018/04/06/death-newsfeed/\">discussion</a> that this is the only way to try and curate the amount of interactions we have to deal with. Its a vicious catch 22 situation.</p>\n<p>In 2014 media focussed on Facebook using this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds\">manipulated timeline </a>to see if it effected peoples feelings and well sure enough it did, but they did this without letting anyone know, they played with peoples feelings to see what happened. The reality of this experiment could have resulted in suicide. Medical trials are governed by a sizeable amount of legal requirements and opt in details, yet it seemed we had all agreed in the terms and conditions that experiments like this where allowed via the Facebook platform. Of course this was and is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many experiments facebook have undertaken based on different segments of their users which have had real impact, such as changes to the news feed based on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/technology/facebook-end-news-feed-experiment-six-countries-that-magnified-fake-news.html\">geolocation</a> which amplified fake news. The latest revelation is that 3rd party use of the Facebook data has had impacts on the outcome of western elections as one company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica\">Cambridge Analytica</a> again manipulated the timelines of friends of friends by gathering a wealth of data and injecting specific types of adverting and curated news in the timelines of many users, a lot who didn’t event use the app that was involved, they happened to have a friend that did. None of these stories and I only pick a few are a surprise, I understand the model of business operated here is <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754\">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>\n<p>In a talk about making games, one question I often pose is that understanding that Google and Facebook are not technology companies but advertising companies changes your understanding of Games such as Candy Crush and Ingress.</p>\n<p>So we know Facebook harvests all the data you put into the site and we also know they use tracking to follow you out of facebook and around the web, and in and out of Apps. In fact we know that facebook also saves things you thing you discard, another study looking at self-censorship (2013) and recent archives reveals lots of data that was never posted (including <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/facebook-secretly-saved-videos-users-deleted.html\">videos</a>).

				"content_text": "Any of my “followers” will be acutely aware that I have been going on about privacy and the invasion of this by corporate Silicon Valley for a little while now.  Their albeit legal but unethical use of data mining has become the sole business model of the vast majority of internet technologies we use. Yet I have accounts on almost all of the services, my wife would say; \n\n>Get out, leave us alone and shut the door behind you..In fact she has numerous times. We only recently refriended on Facebook.\n\nI was I have to admit an addict to signing up to any new internet service which is why I have accounts nearly everywhere, back in the early days of the web this was pretty exciting and something I felt compelled to do. Also it was the one way to secure that precious username, some accounts lay very dormant and some I still use more regularly. \n\nOne such service is Facebook, over the years friends and family have slowly joined Facebook. My many attempts prior to this to try and get family to consider sharing online was well met normally with “why would I want to do that” Even robust and Friendly cross platform private services such as Flickr or such never worked, the technical barriers albeit low still were still to high, it was only for the nerds, of course this did change not rapidly but slowly. So to be fair it is nice to see more images, comments and links from family and friends via Facebook. \n\nOver time Facebook adjusted its timeline and went from a chronological based timeline to an algorithmic timeline, in fact all the popular social network services have ended up doing this, there has been some [discussion](http://thoughtshrapnel.com/2018/04/06/death-newsfeed/) that this is the only way to try and curate the amount of interactions we have to deal with. Its a vicious catch 22 situation. \n\nIn 2014 media focussed on Facebook using this [manipulated timeline ](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds)to see if it effected peoples feelings and well sure enough it did, but they did this without letting anyone know, they played with peoples feelings to see what happened. The reality of this experiment could have resulted in suicide. Medical trials are governed by a sizeable amount of legal requirements and opt in details, yet it seemed we had all agreed in the terms and conditions that experiments like this where allowed via the Facebook platform. Of course this was and is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many experiments facebook have undertaken based on different segments of their users which have had real impact, such as changes to the news feed based on [geolocation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/technology/facebook-end-news-feed-experiment-six-countries-that-magnified-fake-news.html) which amplified fake news. The latest revelation is that 3rd party use of the Facebook data has had impacts on the outcome of western elections as one company [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica) again manipulated the timelines of friends of friends by gathering a wealth of data and injecting specific types of adverting and curated news in the timelines of many users, a lot who didn’t event use the app that was involved, they happened to have a friend that did. None of these stories and I only pick a few are a surprise, I understand the model of business operated here is [surveillance capitalism](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754). \n\nIn a talk about making games, one question I often pose is that understanding that Google and Facebook are not technology companies but advertising companies changes your understanding of Games such as Candy Crush and Ingress.\n\nSo we know Facebook harvests all the data you put into the site and we also know they use tracking to follow you out of facebook and around the web, and in and out of Apps. In fact we know that facebook also saves things you thing you discard, another study looking at self-censorship (2013) and recent archives reveals lots of data that was never posted (including [videos](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/facebook-secretly-saved-videos-users-deleted.html)). All of these actions, tracking, storing, saving with you knowing is to ensure they can better curate your timeline which is so you spend more time in the Facebook eco system itself, as the more time spent on Facebook the more targeted the advertising can be and the more money that an be charged for that adverts spot. For some people Facebook is the web.\n\nSo every often I would cut back on direct Facebook interactions. I have Firefox on my Mac and iOS set to block all trackers and have Firefox Focus Blocker turn on for iOS Safari, I use 3rd parties for other browsers on Mac and iOS including [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) (although I now understand Ghostery sells data to advertisers) and[ind.ie’s Better](https://2017.ind.ie/blog/better/). I also use [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1) a privacy based DNS. I now only cross post my content to Facebook  and Twitter.

Twitter has recently killed off 3rd party app [integration](http://apps-of-a-feather.com/).

I will be writing in more detail about this however there is little that seems to have advanced in this regard since the mid 2000’s and so I would like to pin down some more current and interesting examples. A key thing is that a spatial interface is not to be confused with a concept map, although there are similarities, a spatial interface is a way to arrange collections of different objects and draw connections between them visually and spatially. I am concerned with a thinking tool to help work out relational information design. Here is a piece on information design I previously <a href=\"http://researchnot.es/7_information_design\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Two keys texts are the following;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marshall, C.C. &amp; Frank M Shipman, I., 1999.<a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/memex/ACM%5C_HypertextTestbed/papers/37.html\"> Spatial Hypertext: An Alternative to Navigational and Semantic Links</a>. pp.1–5.</li>\n<li>Bernstein, M., 2013. <a href=\"http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mwra1g13/msc/comp6045/pdfs/Bernstein%20-%20Can%20We%20Talk%20about%20Spatial%20Hypertext.pdf\">Can We Talk about Spatial Hypertext?</a>, pp.1–10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However what I am keen to gather in the first instance is more examples of spatial interfaces.

A key thing is that a spatial interface is not to be confused with a concept map, although there are similarities, a spatial interface is a way to arrange collections of different objects and draw connections between them visually and spatially. I am concerned with a thinking tool to help work out relational information design. Here is a piece on information design I previously [wrote](http://researchnot.es/7_information_design).\n\nTwo keys texts are the following;\n\n- Marshall, C.C. & Frank M Shipman, I., 1999.[ Spatial Hypertext: An Alternative to Navigational and Semantic Links](http://cs.brown.edu/memex/ACM%5C_HypertextTestbed/papers/37.html). pp.1–5.\n- Bernstein, M., 2013. [Can We Talk about Spatial Hypertext?](http://students.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mwra1g13/msc/comp6045/pdfs/Bernstein%20-%20Can%20We%20Talk%20about%20Spatial%20Hypertext.pdf), pp.1–10.\n\nHowever what I am keen to gather in the first instance is more examples of spatial interfaces. Here are my starters.\n\n- Aquanet\n- [VIKI](http://csdl.tamu.edu/~marshall/viki-sidebar.html)\n- [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/)\n- [Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/) \n- [Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.com/)\n\nPlease join the [discussion here](https://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk/t/spatial-interface-and-ui-examples/176) and post any interesting spatial interfaces.\n\nAs an aside, Frode Hegland in his web science PhD is also undertaking some work in this field with what he calls [liquid views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcs6umMYg9k). This is an interactive way to work with a text document as a researcher.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2017/e15cfc7c38.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"212\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2017/e79e9b6286.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"295\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1123/2017/6dfa67885a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"341\" />\n",
