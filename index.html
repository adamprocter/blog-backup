			 <p>Yeah! We (Wimbledon) won, John Green was in attendance and said he likes our podcast plus I had a great evening at Batesford Boys 50th anniversary meal yesterday at Plough Lane too. Yes I had a fall asleep on train pain (don’t ask) BUT It’s a weird and wonderful weekend! COYD</p>

			 <p>Switched up to the sw smart card for trains over Trainline app as there are suggested savings aka no booking fees. Using uber for my football trains now too as gain credits. I am trying to get money savvy for 2025. Will I miss trainline app end of year review maybe 🤔 😂</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Having my own VPS these days seems like an expense I don’t need… I guess I’m just an old internet person who likes to have his own server for stuff and mucking about. It does still run things for me I need / want but I suspect an actual plan could see monthly costs reduce 🤪🤦🤷😜</p>
