			 <p>In 1994 my Mum took me to the Cardiff animation festival to see the event and I recall very much being amazed by models from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06t3ys5">Aardmans</a> Wallace &amp; Gromit (the wrong trousers) and some from Tim Burtons Nightmare Before Christmas. Two of my favourite films and directors. I managed to get Nick Park to sign a Feathers McGraw card and he wrote something like “Wishing you the best” (I would have to dig into loft for exact words). I always knew I wanted to make “cartoons” since I can recall but I never knew exactly how you went about this. I am confident this trip inspired me to think that anyone can and also that in the UK it was possible to pursue the craft of animation. Thankfully I secured a place after some poor GCSEs in Autumn 94 to join Portsmouth Art School on a general art &amp; design BTEC and then after a nail biting interview experience and portfolio review in 1996 I was accepted to start a BA in Animation in Newport South Wales, it would become an amazingly transformative time. Now I wait for the latest Wallace and Gromit installment out Dec 2024. 30+ years later since a grand day out, the wrong trousers and that initial visit to Cardiff how time flies indeed.</p>

			 <p>I Made This - <a href="https://dctr.pro/2pq">dctr.pro/2pq</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/siracusa">@siracusa</a> talking about ownership and AI. Back in Jan. US law has also been moving on this and the topic of ownership came up in my AI workshop last week when I used Midjourney as part of it
Here is a link to the terms updated in March 2024 - <a href="https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service">docs.midjourney.com/docs/term&hellip;</a></p>
<p>As I assumed you do own the images created but you also give Midjourney rights to all your prompts and any images produced in the system (service).</p>
<p>Images and prompts whenever they are posted are done in a public setting by default, the images are publically viewable and thus remixable.</p>
<p>However if you purchase the Stealth feature as part of Your “Pro” or &ldquo;Mega&rdquo; subscription Midjourney agrees to <em>make best efforts</em> not to publish any assets</p>
<p>Previously it seemed for free accounts Midjourney claimed to licence the files to you under a non commercial Creative Commons licence this no longer seems to be the case. The only exceptions now relate to upscaling other peoples work the original owner still owns the work and if you earn more than  $1,000,000 USD a year in revenue you have to be subscribed to pro or mega packages.</p>

			 <p>This article in general is an argument against the idea of using science fiction to think critically about AI</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, I ask whether science fiction is sometimes not only an inadequate context for such critical thinking, but an especially bad one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was mainly drawn to this quote later and issues of retraining based on removal of what a system has ingested in being training, the costs and the issue of applying human traits to machine processes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, there is a lively and important discourse around what rights creators should have in relation to the scraping and use of our works for the training of ML models. This discourse tends to demonstrate that the distinction between training data and model is not widely and deeply understood. For example, to definitively remove one short paragraph from GPT-4 would effectively cost hundreds of millions of dollars, insofar as the model would need to be retrained from scratch on the corrected training data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Appreciation of how texts are (or are not) represented in LLMs could inform keener appreciation of how the world is (or is not) represented in LLMs, and help us to be aware of and to manage our tendency to anthropomorphize.</p>

<p>Every time we use the term “hallucination,” it is harder to remember that Clippy is a better mental model for existing AI than Skynet is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It might be too late to withdraw the election of “hallucination” to term du jour in the public discourse, but we may still be able to draw on Mjolsness, Baker, and Kanade’s version of the term to recast AI’s output as the bullshit it truly is.</p>

			 <p>Strange football “fans” that want their team to lose. Erm nope win every game who cares about anybody else. Win every game you play. That’s pretty much the rule of thumb. Premier league has some strange “fans” but hey Premier league is also anti football fans so 🤷</p>

			 <p>Next month I am doing a thing in Theatre Royal Winchester as part of AI and Arts Festival - check it out</p>
<p>WetAI Lab: PaintR – Dr Adam Procter and Dr Christina Mamakos</p>
<p>In this session Dr Adam Procter will talk about his work related to human centred and human understandable Education Technology and AI considerations.</p>
<p>Dr Christina Mamakos will present thoughts around how contemporary painting practice might inform image/text AI technology.</p>
<p>Together with attendees we will workshop the process of creating prompts and creating images. Both attendees and machines will develop images from the prompts, a human to human and human to machine workshop. Helping us explore the way we process and understand text to image as humans and machines!</p>

			 <p>I am no AI luddite nor do I fear the AI, but for a start its not Artificial, it has huge real world impact, its not Intelligent, its not magic and its not unfathomable, we should stop ascribing human traits to machines, running programmes. AI is useful but it is not the hype machine many would have you believe and we need to be critical about the current approaches to building and using AI.</p>
<p>I estimated just for water needed for my photos to gain alt text on micro.blog with the new AI tool (powered by the blackbox of chatGPT4) This process would need at least 58 litres of water to complete.</p>
<p>2351 photos / 20 = 117.55 bottles
117 * 500ml = 58,500</p>
<p>This doesn’t take into account the fact the query is not just a question but involves machine vision nor have I factored energy use.</p>
<p>Yes I think all my photos should have alt text and am slowly manually adding to a number of them and plan to be more diligent going forward but I dont want to waste water and energy on automating this process at this stage in approaches to AI. Hopefully soon on device LLMs on my iPhone or ways to do this locally on my Mac will automate the process but with considerable less wastage.</p>

			 <p>So today I was doing some googling and someone I know I noted has a wikipedia page but someone else I know who I felt was if not more notable didn’t so I thought it would be nice to add them and also I feel they were worthy of being included. I had recently wanted to edit Wikipedia as my work Winchester School of Art has a poor page and it had bothered me.</p>
<p>I did an ok job on the new person page copying from another person page also bear in mind I only recently got editing access back as my original Wikipedia username from probably 20+ years ago contained the word bot and so I was banned for a while as I tried to explain that I wanted to keep this name.</p>
<p>Anyway within less than 30 mins my new person page was flagged for speedy deletion. I updated my reasons on the talk page as directed. Subsequently I got no reply and the page I created is now deleted.</p>
<p>I remember when Wikipedia was about the idea that it wasn’t about a group of privileged white men deciding who could and couldn’t be included into the Britannica Encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>It seems now the case is the same but instead it’s online and not printed.</p>
<p>I tried to add someone that I think has contributed to very specific research and theory in the space of digital literacies and is known in this space. I would have thought digital literacy would be something Wikipedia would care about and might want to include know figures.</p>

So now I take the slower train home from a station that is not catered for a lot (see image - Shawford) should have looked at the platform boards I guess but when I said to the guard he was “yeah sorry we got delayed as we had a wheelchair user” hmm I said maybe you need to cater for all your passengers better… I said but fair as hey trains have had no invest for years. He said well your be pleased we voted to strike again. I said no as you always strike on a Saturday when I go to football with my family. But I hear you. 🚂 and pains</p>

<p>His actions have brought into question many of the values we hold dear for our club by seemly being one thing in public and yet another in private. We are a community club and his actions no matter what else are disgraceful and damaging.</p>
<p>There are many questions this whole incident raises none of them would make his actions ever ok and none of which I want to articulate as in no way would I ever want to condone any of this behaviour.

			 <p>Before I went vegan I was a massive fan of Greek Moussaka. I have a small appetite and am in the bracket of small and often, it’s a pain as eating out often means I waste food but Greek Moussaka was one dish I could just keep eating and eating and eating.</p>
<p>Randomly after visiting an Art opening event in Southampton at <a href="https://aspacearts.org.uk/events/ght-2058-asylo-%d8%ac%d9%86%d9%91%d8%aa-by-bijan-moosavi">Gods House tower</a> - by Iranian artist Bijan Moosavi as part of their Art for Climate Action Programme, it was an immersive exhibition submerging you in a fictional near-future climate dystopia created by neoliberal negligence and greed in 2058 and had representation of the space we stood, which basically meant the sea level swamped most of the city. (Not enough to get to my house mind)</p>
<p>Anyway I am not know for my spontaneity but I said to my wife let’s go for dinner and so as we walked home we looked at places to eat, that the advantage of living in a city indeed, so we picked a Lebanese restaurant, we have always been fans of Lebanese food but I hadn’t eaten out or considered to search vegan Lebanese.</p>
<p>The [restaurant](Beity - <a href="https://4sq.com/2PM4RUr">https://4sq.com/2PM4RUr</a>) was lovely and they had a dish called Lebanese Moussaka which it turns out is vegan.</p>
<p>It is now one of my favourite dishes and since visiting the restaurant I have made it at home twice already. Although very different to Greek Moussaka it is again a dish I can eat and eat.</p>
<p>Here is a good article on the dish and crucially how to make it ! - <a href="https://dctr.pro/2os">dctr.pro/2os</a></p>
<p>I shall be looking up more Lebanese vegan dishes for sure.</p>

			 <p>Since iOS15 apparently you can increase the font size within individual apps, which seems rather useful, most apps now, even with my reading glasses on iOS16 with dynamic type up to 135% are too small for me now.</p>
<p>But even on my phone with dynamic text up to max across the phone, some apps still have way too small fonts in parts of their interface. However, adjusting further in accessibility settings makes everything too big for me. Unknown until now, there is, in fact, a setting per app that has allowed me to finally get, for example, outlook writing email font at a size that is no longer insanely small… here is how for any app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings</li>
<li>Control Centre
(make sure access within apps is on – should be)</li>
<li>Add Text Size to the included controls section</li>
<li>Open up an app, that likes tiny fonts</li>
<li>swipe down from top right to access control centre</li>
<li>tap the aA icon</li>
<li>tap the App name only icon</li>
</ul>
<p>And bang, you can go slide the font&rsquo;s size up further. See attached images, that&rsquo;s 135% + 120% in Outlook only – happy days!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Unfortunately, no matter what Disney+ or even the BBC will tell you the story of Wrexham is not a fairy tale.</p>
<p>There is no magic, the main character is not poor and underprivileged or the underdog triumphing over adversity, and it’s certainly not clear who is good and who is bad.</p>
<p>In fact, what this story really does is shine another spotlight on the poor state of the English football pyramid and that it can be easily manipulated by money.</p>
<p>Wrexham, have won the title and thus been automatically promoted out of the national conference league because two very rich Americans and a Disney+ deal paved the way purely by ploughing money into the club.</p>
<p>At this stage, this money is not an investment, it is an unsustainable business being bankrolled for now.</p>
<p>Players at Wrexham currently earn around 3 times other players in the same league and the squad costs will not doubt only increase in league 2 as the chairman suggests that “the sky’s the limit” to future success.</p>
<p>Although Wrexham didn’t pay much in transfer fees whilst in the conference (one season longer than they hoped). Ollie Palmer from Wimbledon was, in fact, one of the highest they did pay.</p>
<p>No doubt, however any future negotiations will get harder as Wrexham could be seen to have an unlimited playing budget. The owners are said to be worth £400m.</p>
<p>The owners have also spent a lot of money on ground, investments of over £10m already. With plans to spend over £90m.</p>
<p>However, for the promotion season the club in fact lost £1.17m which was an increased loss on the previous season.</p>
<p>The hope is that due to the international coverage and such they will draw people to watch Wrexham who never have. I know of one person who for the first time ever paid a subscription to watch important matches. This hope needs to result in a larger income next season from again the Disney+ deal, £300k+ per episode, more TV coverage (potentially Sky taking the EFL rights) and increased online subscriptions, perhaps Wrexham’s arrive might bring a competitor to the current iFollow?</p>
<p>However, this tale only ends with an exit strategy and that strategy will be for the current owners to get a return on their investment. This exit strategy is likely aiming for a big sell out once they reach the dizzying heights of the Premier League.</p>
<p>So, having bought Wrexham for £2million, losing over £1m a season and on going investment in the ground.</p>
<p>Lets for argument sakes, as most league teams are unsustainable, Wrexham in fact continue to lose more money every year as costs of maintaining a higher league position go up, and they invest the final sums they mention into the stadium.</p>
<p>We could say the total investment could wind up at at least £200 million maybe?</p>
<p>At this rate would mean the value of the club would have to be at least that of a mid-table Premier League team at that point.</p>
<p>The Newcastle take over bid was reportedly worth an estimated £300 million.</p>
<p>The population of Newcastle is about the same as Wrexham 60,000.</p>
<p>Be warned, this is not a fairy tale. The Brothers Grimm have an exit strategy, and it could well be in 6–8 years' time, but it will not be to the club&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
<p>This whole story says more about the state of the pyramid and the need for the governance of football to be seriously looked at.</p>
<p>The more money that flows down the pyramid, the more investment into community, grassroots and more. The more the money flows up the pyramid into lining the pockets of a few, the worse things will get for all involved in these clubs and their communities.</p>
<p>I suspect there are a number of Wrexham fans who are concerned, who have raised a voice. As of today, the supporters trust website doesn’t even have an up to date SSL certificate, so it was hard to browse, and I know that the take-over was welcomed generally by the trust. The trust did save the club before however for the take-over they had to give up all control, which they did voted on and agreed to this. So they would have to fight again to regain control.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="aside">Aside</h2>
<p>You could argue Wimbledons rise back from the combined counties league (that’s 5 leagues lower than the conference) all the way to League 2 was also the fact that we had more money than most other clubs in each league as we progressed. Getting out of the Conference was the hardest and certainly this is not a league I would relish a return too. However, we are the fairy tale. We own our club, our ground and have a stable sustainable base to build from especially since COVID-19 we have finally started to properly settled into our new stadium and all the benefits this brings.</p>
<p>We have now doubled our gates (even after being relegated from League 1) and have started to put in place a much more professional layers of staffing to run the football side of operations, some may say we have been a bit slow in this regard and perhaps that is part of what has put us into a really poor end of this season. But I am feeling optimistic about next season and will welcome Wrexham to Plough Lane and let the media see the real fairy tale still in the making.</p>
<p>Be interesting to see what happens with TikTok as Wrexhams sponsor as less useful being banned in the states and gov.uk. But that’s another post about terrible football sponsorship.</p>

			 <p>Lesia and I had a fantastic week at our first GDC and first time in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Many of the talks, round tables and showcases validated a lot of what we currently undertake with our students on Games at Winchester School of Art (WSA), specifically relating to games for change, games and the climate crisis and experimental games, those that tell stories and approaches from the marginalised, the different and the under represented.</p>
<p>The Independent Games Festival and the Experimental Games Workshop really exemplified this at GDC.</p>
<p>Which is why it was sad to return home and read reports of sexual harassment, spiked drinks and likely worse against women at GDC.</p>
<p>I admit I am shocked but more so, I am angry.</p>
<p>Those of you that know me know that a big part of my position and take on games and the tech industry is born out of being sickened to see misogyny I personally witnessed almost 20 years ago at tech events.</p>
<p>I am determined as a father of 3 daughters that games and tech should be a safe space for all women and have thus wanted to help where I could.</p>
<p>The mission is never complete, we at WSA will continue to create and get better at making safe spaces for anyone that wants to make games and loves and understands the power of games.</p>
<p>If you witnessed or were a victim of any harassment at GDC no matter how small you may think it was, call it out. These people don&rsquo;t belong in the games industry, and it&rsquo;s time to normalise the utter rejection of this type of behaviour.</p>
<p>Please look to support any initiatives you can as well such as Women in Games in your area or the UK Raise the Game initiative.</p>
<p>There are many more initiatives I am not aware of so please do seek out, the majority, the good people in games and tech and rid this industry of a rotten minority that need to be gone.</p>

			 <p>Working out day two next at #gdc</p>
<p>Day one was mainly spent attending a full day workshop on using games to help tackle the climate disaster,which was excellent, our team came up with a fun hyper casual simulation called “the farmers dream” in which you are government granted to transform your industrial farm into a more sustainable and local farm using drip irrigation, mitigating against water shortages and as you do so you will be rewarded by seeing the positive effects on the local community around your farm and ward of bigger climate events. Our impact was that our non gamer audience might consider consumption choices in the grocery store based on new knowledge of how supporting local not only boosts your local economies but also helps fight the climate crisis. Not bad for a day of talks and breakouts!</p>
<p>We then wrapping up day one for the evening we joined another queue to attend a local Bay Area game dev showcase - <a href="https://lnkd.in/eTStvV88">lnkd.in/eTStvV88</a></p>
<p>It was so busy we took local advise and heading to wait it out at a dive bar where we played another local game dev yet to be released twin stick local Co-op game <a href="https://lnkd.in/e-GsZfAw">lnkd.in/e-GsZfAw</a></p>
<p>Before heading back to the meetup for a now slightly shorter queue to final play more games #gdc #gamesdesign #gdc2023 #southampton #sanfrancisco</p>

			 <p>Having worked on my own spatial hypertext tool (nodenogg.in) built from and found an education need upwards for the last 5/6 years to see another tool enter the arena from a big player in the form of Apples Freeform is yet another let down.</p>
<p>I’m not surprised but for a new Apple product in a long time, was iWork the last?</p>
<p>There is no innovation beyond other current products like Miro,
Mural, FigJam, Milanote or Muse (the list goes on dare I mention $2m in VC for tldraw only a week or so ago)</p>
<p>Freeform is so woefully not different or new. I mean it will probably Shelock a few of these products unfortunately out there but there is way more resistance to Apple lock in now.</p>
<p>I for one don’t need the next big reason I can’t leave macOS or iOS to be not only are my photos locked in but also my thinking. Of course it always totally rails against principles I have defined in my research relate to thinking in a networked system and a spatial hypertext system in the tools for thought space that they and other education technology must be;</p>

			 <p>We moved from a village to the city. It’s an Excellent location we love it’s proximity to shops, train and vibrancy but most of our street is rented out to students as HMOs (houses of multiple occupancy) like ours was until we bought it, since moving in I have seen 2 grow additional bedrooms in the lofts and gardens and have opposed a whole “house” being built in a garden, the HMOs are packed in by greedy landlords and if they can’t get extra buildings build they just figure out how to gut the inside for more rooms. One of the many issues this causes is there is not enough bins and thus the collection of bins is not adequate. As bin day draws near or not (see photo) more and more items due to our proximity to the coast are blow down the road and no longer anyone’s issue, it seems that around 6 weeks ago my oldest cat who likes to wander, we suspect cut his tongue on a tin can and although he has 3 set of antibiotics and pain killers he has lost a sizeable chunk of his tongue and over the last few days he can’t eat and it seems after various vets trips and hundreds of pounds it’s likely he will die. I hate landlords so much. And if your a student or someone crammed into a property not only does it look untidy and trashes the local environment you may do more damage that you think so hey try and manage you bins so the lid closes, if it doesn’t ask the council for another bin or make a trip to the tip. Don’t make our street look like a tip and become dangerous for its occupants and their pets.</p>

			 <p>Proposers: Niall Couper and Melvyn Procter</p>
<p>I have been a Wimbledon fan since the 1980s and am a Season ticket holder with my Dad and Daughter.</p>
<p>I am standing again to be a member of the Dons Trust board, as I want us to be the best club we can be, both on and off the pitch. So, I would like to officially dedicate some of my time to this.</p>
<p>I work at the University of Southampton, and currently I lead a top ten games course. I work on digital education strategy for the university and am a fellow in creative research engagement for the research institute of Arts and Humanities, and previously led our department of Art &amp; Media Technology.</p>
<p>I will bring my experience to the DT board to move AFC Wimbledon forward in two key areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Unique Selling Point (USP)</li>
<li>Our Education provision</li>
</ul>
<p>A vote for me will be another voice on the DT board that will advocate for taking full advantage of our USP, that of a fan owned club.</p>
<p>This to me means a club about people and planet. 
Why? Because this is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I believe we can and should take advantage of this positioning to attract new fans, both locally and globally. I am confident we can attract new sponsors and partnerships by clearly defining our position of being a sustainable, ethical, and environmentally focussed fan owned club.</p>
<p>This positioning will make us attractive to a global audience and global sponsorship.</p>
<p>94% of our members voted that we must be fan owned, but what is more important is to take advantage of this fact to progress on the pitch.</p>
<p>We can do this by increasing our income by striving to be different and showing what fan ownership really means.</p>
<p>Once we adopt this focus, we can build out a branding around our mission and take that to ethical and sustainable companies, partners, and organisations.</p>
<p>Our new shirt is made with Eco8 technology from Hummel meaning each shirt is manufactured from high-performing polyester produced from up to eight recycled plastic bottles.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive makers of Football Manager donate from every sale of their game to war child and have provided them to date with £1.5m to support children affected by conflict.</p>
<p>We can leverage more of these ties by making our positioning clear. I will bring my design thinking and leadership experience to help the board and club market our USP.</p>
<p>In Sept 2022 the education hub will start a new BTEC in eSports, I think our education offer, apprentice schemes and university year in employment schemes could be leveraged to attract younger and more diverse fans to AFC Wimbledon.</p>
<p>eSports is huge new market, in 2019 42,000+ people attended live eSports events in the UK and one event in the same year, the final of Fortnite, was watched by over 2 million people.</p>
<p>My background is not directly eSports; however, I will bring connections and experience from the world of gaming – the biggest entertainment industry on the planet that caters to over 4 Billion players – to the DT Board, club and stadium.</p>
<p>I will bring my experience of working with young adults in higher education for over 20 years to the DT board.</p>
<p>A vote for me will mean continued advocation for young, diverse people and gaming at AFC Wimbledon to the board increasing our income.</p>
<p>In terms of related practical steps.</p>
<p>We must make joining the Dons Trust much more attractive worldwide, through our USP, but also, I would push forward a membership opt in with season ticket renewal, I believe this is in discussion and I would advocate that we must do this.</p>
<p>I would ask for a rebranding of the Dons Trust in consultation and partnership with our younger fans and more diverse fans to make the membership as attractive as possible.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem we utilise our whole fan base expertise, including our younger fans at all, so we need to look at how we improve our club volunteer offer and rewards programme.</p>
<p>I can directly bring a gaming and the environment event to Plough Lane centred around Daybreak a new board game made by the creator of Pandemic.</p>
<p>I will bring my enthusiasm, leadership, and experience to several other key areas specifically to help support better structures at the club, the paid roles at the club and where improvements should be made. I will use my experience of free and open-source software communities to ask the DT board and club to be as open and transparent as possible and improve all of its communication channels.
I will at every turn ask the club to dare to be different.</p>
<p>To support inclusion, I have also uploaded a recorded audio version of this text with captioning onto YouTube. <a href="https://dctr.pro/dtm22">dctr.pro/dtm22</a></p>

<p>Generic Plumber A, who did fit stuff excellent for us in conversion of ground bedroom to family room to be fair but said more than once - “boiler is too small for this house and rainfall showerhead was probably not a good idea” - new boiler circa £2k + fitting</p>
<p>Called local Viesmann approved plumber “this part is probably blocking / blocked and needs replacing, the services previous on boiler didn’t do all the cleaning that we are trained to do, that’s obvious” part and service circa £400…</p>
<p>And guess what💥 Boom mega hot power rainfall shower wooo</p>
<p>Also advised a small part that maybe on the way out, but has re inflated it (didn’t force a instant replacement) and said what to look out for if it is actually perforated (aka why it had deflated), I said ok shall I make a note of that, he said no I will remember (not I’ll log it in the system).</p>

			 <p>Adobe you MUST provide a migration tool for moving cloud documents between profiles and you MUST provide a bulk export of all files in the cloud. Holding files hostage is brutal and not human centred design at all. I am expecting to lose some of my work. I have managed to get the most important things by the slow process of downloading them 1 at a time, sometimes 10 at a time when the Creative Cloud app played ball. I may write up a bigger post on this as its so hostile and we the creative industries and the students I teach are being held hostage to a monopoly in so many directions it&rsquo;s just wrong. As personal budgets get tighter some people will need to cancel their Adobe Subscriptions, but with the issue they may never get access to their own work again, especially when you then delete them from the Cloud of the inactive accounts. This is out of order to a magnitude of 10/10.</p>

<p>Brilliant talk (with BSL provided too) and fantastic q&amp;a.</p>
<p>I found it kinda fitting that he left his timer on the lecturn which I grabbed to keep safe but later forgot was in my pocket and was re-found while sorting a Brewdog Punk IPA for the train ride home.</p>

The opensource discussion hits on the issue with opensource licences. Go for a proper free software GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 license as this means future contributions are to the wider software eco system not necessary back to your product they can still sell products etc but they can’t lock down the new code. Again it’s about thinking about different approaches to sustainable software. A big concern is a lot of our tech stacks rely on open source and these projects do not have many contributors really beyond a core group that is often small and vulnerable. <a href="https://dctr.pro/2ni">dctr.pro/2ni</a></p>

			 <p>Please be warned this is a pretty sad blog post.</p>
<p>Very recently we finally managed to buy and move to a larger place in Southampton, this and work has kept me from posting much recently. This move was to provide a stable, we rented, and better space for the family which not included my mother in law who had come to live with us since the end of Dec of 2020, she was struggling to look after herself and there was a brief window in COVID restrictions enabling us to easily get her. Unlike the UK government ministers we strictly obeyed the rules.</p>
<p>And yes that’s how long (16 months) a single no chain house sale and no chain buy goes in the UK, don’t talk to me about estate agents and solicitors I don’t have a good word to say about them, and let’s just say we where not fussing in our selling our buying we moved fast, they did not.</p>
<p>So by mid / end of April 2022 we finally got the keys to the place we wanted, it needed some minor tweaks to the rear of the property for a proper wet room and larger family space, we found amazing builders that cracked on straight away.  And by mid May it was pretty much completed. We all moved in 24 May.</p>
<p>But on the 1st of June, 8 days after all the boxes and mother in law arrived in her new bedroom, she had pain, out of the blue, we thought perhaps anxiety from the move, she has slight dementia, perhaps a flare up of Diverticulitis, a conditon she had before.</p>
<p>Yet here I am sat in the hospice where she has been for around 8 days now, everyone including the paramedics that took her to hospital for pain relief and the doctors didn’t expect any issues beyond the diverticulitis and a quick discharge but they did take a routine CT scan, this scan instead of revealed nothing of significance shed light on completely unknown late stage terminal cancer.</p>
<p>My mother in law is 85 but we expected at least a summer or more in the new home together, relaxed in a surrounding that fitted us all much more comfortably. The location we are in is also very flat and central and provides easy access to coffee shops and easy trips out with a wheel chair, trips we will never perform now.</p>
<p>Moving house is stressful, moving house with the specific intention to provide better final days for your Mother in law was the plan, for it to be cut so short is a shock for all the family.</p>
<p>The hospital said days but she keeps motoring on, we have all been doing shifts in the wonderful local hospice on z beds and such, so she is never alone, she has always wanted and needed company, being brought up in a not so good orphanage around / after World War 2 and being very hard of hearing, the last thing she wanted was to feel isolated and like she had returned to a place on her own where no one cared.</p>
<p>Here the staff not only care but have been gracious and kind to allow us to come and go as we please, at one point (so far) the max has been 5 family members camped out in her room and many daily visitors which has been lovely.</p>
<p>She is not in pain and is enjoying the family around her and any treats she would like.</p>
<p>Some of 2022 won’t turn out quite as I expected. Some of it doesn’t really matter, some of it does.</p>

			 <p>Visiting St Mary’s for the first time.</p>
<p>I attended the U18 premiership national final Southampton FC v Manchester City with my daughter, us both seasoned football goers. Have to say it started well, Man City played much better football through out the game, but Southampton scored first, which kept everyone happy however with no away fans and going on to lose it became a bit of a strange atmosphere I suspect the free tickets playing a roll.</p>
<p>It seems that lots of school kids, without adults and clearly didn’t know what it means to attend a game in person, many arrived late, left early, seemed to be mainly in the Northam stand, the one we were in. At first many started what appeared to be throwing rubbish but it became clear was actual attempts at  paper aeroplanes started to throw them down the stands. A few kids were told to stop by the insane amount of stewards in place. However one kid clearly attempting to launch numerous planes at the pitch wasn’t stopped until projectile 3 all the time watched by the steward  =who finally decided he had better as the kid to refrain 🤦🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>One person ran onto the pitch mid game thankfully not disrupting or attacking anyone but by the end of the game lots of kids where on the edge of the pitch at the bottom of the Northam stand, all stewards were moved to monitor this area but it was clear what was going to happen and they did little to stop what was then a mass pitch invasion after the whistle which was not great.</p>
<p>Southampton having lost, and the kids clearly reveling on just being on the pitch it seemed like this was perhaps a mass dare issued at local Schools that day, eventually the PA announced anyone caught invading the pitch would have a 7 year ban.</p>
<p>I suspect they never have or plan to go to another game anyway.  I cant make any of the womens Euro games at St Marys (which is now a 20minute walk for me) but I plan to visit a pre season friendly as I suspect that will have a different atmosphere. Not sure my daughter will want to attend St Mary’s again. (to note someone behind her kept touching her hair, she told me afterwards and one close by kid needed a lesson in how to shower&hellip;.)</p>
<p>Makes me even more appreciate our fan owned club and community stadium in Wimbledon.</p>

<p>From Feb I will be the brand new Interim Head of an also brand new Department of Art &amp; Media Technology at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton.</p>
<p>Hopefully if successful I will be able to make it a more permanent role (application and interview dependant)</p>
<p>But from Feb to August I will still be Programme leader for BA Games Design &amp; Art so I will be pretty busy however I have plans…</p>
<p>At the end of Jan I should have internally submitted my PhD text and come the end of March be waiting on my viva dates hopefully end of Easter / early summer so come Sept I will finally officially be Dr. Procter.</p>
<p>So if things go to plan I could be a Doctor running a new department with some exciting approaches to technology and humans from October.</p>
<p>As anyone who has read my blog or knows me I am very keen to push back on big tech, surveillance capitalism and this is something that has been my conversation piece to enable me to be given the interim role so embedding ethical and humane technology thinking and criticality in the new Department will be fundemental.</p>
<p>The Department already has amazing staff and students and a brilliant set of programmes of study.</p>
<p>Combine this with new structures and new programmes to come starting in earnest in October 2022 it is all pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Much hard work to come but it feels like an exciting new chapter awaits.</p>
<p>Of course I’ll keep people up to date on my blog if it all falls apart 🤣😬 or not 😊🙌</p>

			 <p>After this weeks announcement of Meta, Facebooks new company, we have to mobilise against Big Tech. Facebook must not be the future of how humans interact with Technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ursula K. Le Guin wrote that the concept of technology is “consistently misused to mean only the enormously complex and specialized technologies of the past few decades, supported by massive exploitation both of natural and human resources.” Rather, she argued, technology should be understood more expansively, as the way “society copes with physical reality… the active human interface with the material world.” Technology, as the sum of “what we can learn to do.” - Digital Public Spaces</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Big Tech is a virus that drains us of our rights, freedoms, and agency. It has the same success criteria as Covid: exponential growth. While we must fight it directly via legislation, we can also vaccinate ourselves against it by funding and building Small Tech.   - Aral Balkan</p>

			 <p>Testing a new group in Ulysses to send and edit post to Micro.blog on Monterey. I have since edited this. The only issue I noted is there doesn’t seem to be a clear indiction whether an edit has been published, until you hit the share icon which means the button says updated but a clue in the sheet would be good. Else I could edit and if I get distracted I may forget to publish.</p>

<p>In a short commentary posted to her website in 2004, science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin wrote that the concept of technology is “consistently misused to mean only the enormously complex and specialized technologies of the past few decades, supported by massive exploitation both of natural and human resources.” Rather, she argued, technology should be understood more expansively, as the way “society copes with physical reality… the active human interface with the material world.” Technology, as the sum of “what we can learn to do.”</p>

			 <p>ABBA new album and brand new tour in custom arena being built now in London blending physical and digital elements to create a unique concert experience. When asked why london ABBA said this is where the culture is, the theatres, the music, this is where the talent and technology is, people flock to London for this type of experience. Perhaps the gov might want to stop slashing creative arts funding and degrading its biggest economy ? ABBA recognise what’s great about the UK creative industries maybe others should too?? <a href="https://youtu.be/OE8aSnhzTfQ">youtu.be/OE8aSnhzT&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>A simple reason privacy matters. My iPhone has warned me my music has been too loud this week. What it doesn’t know is that I have connected it to a Bluetooth / headphone jack speaker a number of times and so the volume has been adjusted on the speaker itself with my iPhone set to max to ensure max output from phone to speaker. Maybe that’s old school thinking to maximise source output sure but then pass this data to my medical records and I could potentially be refused hearing aids in the future, see my insurances rise or be refused treatment for ear conditions. This is why data is useless without the owner being in control. Apple your approach to CSAM appals me. And yeah I’m a long term fan boy.</p>

			 <p>Football fans, those that see the community we have built, those that want to see how football can be done differently, to see how it feels to own your club, I encourage you to make the pilgrimage to see the new stadium, see our community and of course watch the real Dons. ⚽️</p>
<p>For all the people that will never get to see our return to Plough Lane this was read out before kick off yesterday over the PA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we gather here today, about to witness Wimbledon’s football club play a home game in front of fans for the first time in 30 years, we would like you to join us as we take a moment to remember those who cannot be with us on this historic day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re talking about the players, the staff, the volunteers and most of all the fans who played their part in making sure Wimbledon still has a football team to call its own for future generations to enjoy in the years ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They didn’t get to be here to see us make that dream come true, but friends, family and fellow fans live on in our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All of those who watched us, travelled the length of the country to support us, campaigned for us, wrote letters for us, raised money for us, gave their time and effort for us - we thank you and we will never forget you - and we hope you are proud of what we have become.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thank you also, of course, to every single person here today and around the world who has contributed to the journey of Wimbledon’s football club. From Old Centrals to Wimbledon FC to AFC Wimbledon, this is the club that refuses to be beaten. The club that defies the odds. The club that is the greatest story in football.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our legendary club Secretary, the late Eric Willocks explained what a football club is for when he said “our fans collect memories”. So we remember all those who’ve shared this journey with us and gives thanks we will all collect more memories back at Plough Lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The journey was long, some people were wrong, we’re AFC Wimbledon and you brought the Dons home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We invite you all now to join us in a minute’s applause to remember all those who can’t be here.</p>

<p>Episode 32 sees us catching up with Adam Procter, who is the Programme Lead for Games Design and Art at The Winchester School of Art, at The University of Southampton. We have a fascinating discussion covering everything from retro gaming and innovative tech right through to open-source, free-software. Plus, I also give my Pocket Operator (PO12 Rhythm) a spin just to give it that old school &lsquo;Super Nintendo&rsquo; vibe! Stephan is back too, keeping us posted on things over in the States including some academic book reviews - brace yourselves, it is a long one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is my ramblings on the latest teaching and scholarship podcast hope it’s at least entertaining and hopefully informative and interesting. Could do deep dive even more on lots of what we covered so if anything piques your interest reach out and I’ll happily chat more on games, free software and design thinking anytime</p>

			 <p>Some people might be following the development of nodenogg.in which is awesome. Thank you. I thought I would give you all the current status of the project, as I’ve been a little quiet while wrapping up semester in my day job running Games Design &amp; Art at WSA.</p>
<p>I have to prioritise writing up the project and creating other materials to present my research for my PhD submission this should be completed in two phases.</p>
<h2 id="phase-1">Phase 1</h2>
<p>The thesis text completed by the end of the summer (Oct) revisions requested from then followed by creation of rich media to show of the project itself.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2">Phase 2</h2>
<p>Fix any text revision requests and book 2 external supervisors for the viva likely first half 2022.</p>
<p>This means however at the moment the alpha build of the nodenogg.in software itself is not getting much attention and the beta Vue 3 (re)build is on pause.</p>
<p>However the positives are I really want to be using specific features of nodenogg.in for Semester 1 (Oct 2021) so I need to do some focussed work and in Jan 2022 there is potential to start building a new view related to podcasts which includes costings for a real JavaScript developer not me just hacking around.</p>
<p>Some of the associated media and writing will also outline approaches to Ed tech for higher education tools which I hope will also give people pause for thought.</p>
<p>I am hoping to post a few more YouTube videos as well soon however I am also taking a stay at home holiday as I am pretty burnt out.</p>

			 <p>Such a good newsletter from <a href="https://micro.blog/epilepticrabbit@mastodon.social">@epilepticrabbit@mastodon.social</a>  this week</p>
<p>This quote from it is excellent;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is productive to slow down, tend the garden and watch the bees. It&rsquo;s productive to contemplate and find solidarity with the rest of the life on this planet. It is productive to just be, not consuming, just searching for acceptance from those who accept you as you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sitting in the garden reading this, well I am sat in the shanty town style lobster shack looking over my garden swimming pool, yeah I know living the dream. I am enjoying the sun and slowly plodding through my SaneNews mailbox listening to a Zero 7 created radio Apple Music mix. The only distraction is my mother in law texting me to ask where I am and when will I sit with her and watch TV, she doesn’t appreciate why I really don’t like watching TV. Oh well she needs company. I told her 5 more minutes. Replies “Thank Goodness xx”</p>
<p>I often suffer from the idea that I am not being productive or as productive as I think I could be, like many I expect and just as Laura states.  For me I think a lot of this is because I expriement a lot, and I mean a lot, with ideas and those experiments don’t tend to lead to specific tangible outcomes but they do transform my thinking and future paths of discovery, and what I then share and discuss with others, so I leave a trail of code, notes, browser tabs in my wake that some find very strange and some have even commented on the impressive prolific output, as I try and share as much as I can openly, on repos, blogs etc. It’s semi interesting just writing this as the part time PhD I am completing, I keep saying this so it comes true, however the PhD itself is about a contribution to knowledge (to pass on) and I often wonder how much I demonstrate the tangible impact of my passing on, but I know the conversations and posts are doing that, and I don’t need any crappy tracking to know.</p>
<p>I’ve also done all the productive type things and am a little systems driven so I have all the apps… I am not sure why sometimes, but I don’t tend to not get things done, this last year is the first time I have ever had to ask for extra time for a few work related tasks and I think the global pandemic and work from home (WFH) are very connected to this. It’s been a hard year for numerous reasons personally and globally.</p>
<p>I did however very much enjoy the <a href="https://hurryslowly.co/reset/">RESET</a> course I did this year and need to revisit all the materials again as they made a lot of sense and it was all about being yourself which chimes with Lauras newsletter.</p>
<p>Well that was longer than expected, I mainly wanted to shout out Lauras newsletter.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/?mailpoet_router&amp;endpoint=view_in_browser&amp;action=view&amp;data=WzE1NSwiNjVlNDc5NDgwOTVjIiwyNzQsImY4Njg0ZiIsMjA5LDBd">letter</a> and why not get Laura a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/laurahilliger">Coffee</a> as a thank you.</p>

			 <p>WAYFINDER is an expression of our connectedness to the natural world. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to renew a damaged ecosystem through discovery and verse.</p>
<p>The calming, contemplative gameplay is symbolic of the cause-and-effect relationship humans have with nature. It underscores our role in both affecting, but ultimately remedying, the effects of climate change through action and a greater appreciation of the environment.</p>
<p>The art is generative. The visual assets and poetry are assembled procedurally and algorithmically through code, creating different combinations for each new visitor.</p>
<p>The textured, hand-illustrated aesthetic is delivered in real-time, and the poetic verses are created with a mix of artificial intelligence/machine learning and generative processes, providing thousands of possible combinations.</p>
<p>As such, Wayfinder is an ever-changing, emergent artwork with infinite possibilities. Each time it runs, it produces a new and individualized world.</p>

			 <p>I was alerted to an insane  page on BBC bite size that talked about “benefits” of climate change for the UK on mastodon by <a href="https://micro.blog/aral@mastodon.ar.al">@aral@mastodon.ar.al</a> I was shocked as there are no positives to the climate crisis the planet faces then the page was since edited and attached is image from today’s Guardian confirms it was changed to be in line with current GCSE curriculum. The BBC probably don’t look at Mastodon by George Monbiot also talked about it on Twitter - nice one everyone</p>

			 <p>My tbc thesis (practice based part time PhD) I cover off problems about open source and why I made my research project FLOSS not OSS or public domain.</p>
<p>This article goes further than what I was attempting to do. I explain by deconstructing the open source.org criteria that this causes conflicts with enriching the overall software eco system and here this article starts to see wider problems discussing the eco system working as extraction.</p>
<p>The author mentions a conversation about FLOSS in 2000 and quotes Bob Hughes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism will always find a way to exploit common resources. It’s just a matter of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think this means the conclusion is proprietary software but the fact that much of the software infrastructure isn’t “actually” paid for is a call for concern. More to think about.</p>

			 <p>We (AFC Wimbledon) are in a league higher than we can really afford at the moment. Part of our future growth is tied to our move to a brand new stadium we only just managed to finance ourselves without losing control, looking at the European Super League nonsense its even clearer why we must never cede control. But we found ourselves rooted to the relegation zone. We changed manager to Robbo and Wow the players are really playing like they really know what a fans club is all about. With 3 wins in row, but not just minor wins. 1-5 away 3-0 home &amp; 4-1 home. Each game the attacking hasn’t stopped the energy of the players to do everything they can to win has been amazing. Numerous local and young academy home grown players now also making the first team. I think this clip of Nesta Guinness-Walker typifies the fight all the team now seem to have found, please note we are already winning 2-0, we went to win this one 4-1. COYD ⚽️</p>

			 <p>Back in 1997 Daft Punk appealed very much to my indie self with a previous love of UK rave culture and house music this record very much in my mind cemented a number of genres together I loved via the record Homework (1997). This was released in the middle of my time at University and at the height of amazing short music videos, such as that directed By Spike Jonze for Da Funk and Michel Gondry directing Around the World.</p>
<p>In 2001 I recall excitedly telling my house mate as I listened to Discovery (2001) that the record was ground breaking and I had never heard anything like it, he was less impressed and preceded to tell me to go listen to some avant garde electronic music, he had missed the point, it really was ground breaking. The Album also was released as a series of music videos inspired by Anime animation under the title Interstella 5555 (2003)</p>
<p>By the release of this record Daft Punk had become their full robot personas.</p>
<p>Human After All (2005) didn’t have as much impact on me personally but I do recall being blown away by Robot Rock at the time. 2006 saw the release of the film by Daft Punk, Electroma, amazing visuals and pace.</p>
<p>2010 saw the release of the music for Tron: Legacy(2010) which was impeccable and so moving. It was probably the most accessible Daft Punk album too, I consider it one of there Albums and not just a sound track.</p>
<p>Of course what I hadn’t appreciated was this was all warming up to Random Access Memories (2013), I initially dismissed this record personally as all the air play of Get Lucky and it’s commercial success really put me off however once I finally sat down and listened to the record I realised the master piece it is.</p>
<p>The 2015 documentary Daft Punk Unchained paints a great picture of the history of this iconic French pair as a pioneer in electronic music.</p>
<p>I was really sad to hear of their retirement.  As with much of their life outside of performing as Daft Punk I doubt we will know much more than the video released <a href="https://dctr.pro/2ku">today</a> (an extract from the 2006 film) as both Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter have been very private people and never wanted to be celebrities.</p>
<p>Thank you Daft Punk.</p>

			 <p>In the background I am rebuilding nodenogg.in in Vue 3 from the ground up and with some of my new branding… putting it on the beta channel as it will take the learning from alpha to have a stable base, allowing alpha to the kick into next gear of experimentation, timelines undefined atm but the beta page will be very limited in term of functionality if any for a while. I want to get a few pieces better in terms of code organisation, overall human experience and human Interface touches before I add back in real logic that underpins nodenogg.in.  <a href="https://beta.nodenogg.in">beta.nodenogg.in</a> - I am putting it on beta as it will be the next stage from the alpha in terms of experience and architecture but alpha will still be progressing a little over the next 6 months and will be the only place to test the new pieces I want to finish for alpha however as I said beta will be a different build process all from my own learnings on alpha… plus subscribed to vue mastery for a year at least to get up to speed on Vue 3 best practice then beta will be the stable channel and duplicated over to alpha for more developments …. its quite exciting…</p>

			 <p>Snuck into end of small tech conversation with a small topic (not! whoops) but as discussion was on funding alternative technologies looking at public bodies I was again wondering if an angle of attack might be back to considering if we understand that we as humans have to have access to the web / connected devices and thus they are a human right in themselves and yet the makers of most technology Google / Facebook etc. don’t respect our human rights in a digital space, that the owner of the data in the first instance must be yourself and the right not to share anything should be the default, who is convincing governments to look at this from a human right POV and then how could that approach unlocking funding of the technology we humans have to use.</p>
<p>Snippet from draft thesis; for contex</p>
<p>William Playfair, considered the founder of graphic representation of statistics and inventor of the line graph, bar chart, pie chart and circle graph states;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As knowledge increases amongst mankind, and transactions multiply, it becomes more and more desirable to abbreviate and facilitate the modes of conveying information from one person to another, and from one individual to many. (Playfair, 1786)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how could the way we convey, make and represent the information generated and presented to this community of practice have a direct impact on what is made. I will argue that what is made is directly effected by the systems we use within this environment and demonstrate this through research, a series of interventions and experiments that have been undertaken during 2016 through to 2020 within this community. I will then discuss the considerations such interventions digital tool makers and those that use them must urgently consider in order to respect the augmentation of ourselves. Aral Balkan renowned digital rights activist states;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once we understand that we extend our selves with technology and that our technology and data lie within the boundaries of the self, then we must insist that the constitutional protections of the self that we have enshrined within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and implemented within our myriad of national laws are extended to protect the cyborg self.(Balkan, 2017)</p>

			 <p>Scottish Power are sending me a cheque, apparently because I cancelled my direct debit because they were ripping me off, it’s the only way they can issue refunds🤪 So I can choose to risk my live going to the bank to get my money back in my account, nice end to the saga&hellip; not&hellip;</p>

<p>Tonight The School of Design starts its series of talks for 2021 members ! You are able to attend one free talk if you are not a member yet, but I suggest you will want to snap up joining at the insanely low £95 a year as you will get access to some amazing resources to level up your design chops, I also know spaces are limited.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer <a href="https://micro.blog/mrmurphy">@mrmurphy</a> is a good friend of mine and I have worked with him and am a paid School of Design member.</em></p>
<p>The talk tonight is a subject I am excited about as Jordan Moore will be talking about his work</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;exploring the rapidly emerging ‘networked notes’ movement (also referred to as the ‘second brain’ movement), powered by tools like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jordon is also building a tool for thought, which I feel has more similarities with <a href="https://nodenogg.in">nodenogg.in</a> (my tool), <a href="https://makespace.fun/">makespace.fun</a>, <a href="https://kinopio.club/">kinopio.club</a> and <a href="https://museapp.com/">muse</a> which focus a little more on spatial UI and delight over Roam and other use of force directed graphs and backlinks text, so I am excited to hear his insights.</p>

			 <p>Fixed the iOS issue ! The issue was having the html5 attribute autofocus on the nodes, this wasn&rsquo;t doing anything as I have a vue directive now to focus on the right element when creating a new node, my guess is that as the elements loaded in, iOS was trying to autofocus as each one &ldquo;loaded&rdquo; which sent it into a death spin??! Purely guessing. Other browsers must have suppressed or ignored this, that was a royal pain to work out as it only crashed on device and web inspector (iOS device connected to mac / safari) gave no more information, here is a little video on nodenogg.in 0.1.48 with the new speedy focus to create ideas (nodes) really fast and the insession card sorting - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmlWXYWOmr8">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The great thing about iterating on nodenogg.in openly is you can get instant feedback. I’m currently re-factoring the node loop code (there is a wider performance issue related to looping through pouchdb / state arrays) and I knew the logic could potentially reintroduce a sync chase bug I had previously squashed however it wasn’t clear as it is a different implementation and it has to do with vues reactivity so in my own testing I couldnt see the bug but when your testing something that is multi player it’s really hard to test. For this test and most other I basically have to have two different machines open and type one handed on each machine at the same time. So I decided I’d put the small update online as it was part of a bigger update and I knew that if this had the bug the next update would be worse as pulling that bug across to the main spatial view would see the bug magnified 10x and fantastically guess what I got in some feedback telling me - <strong>typing is slow and skips letters</strong> - aka the bug! I have thought about having an alpha site and a beta site but that would segment the people and would also mean I won’t get such instant feedback. Rolled back site to previous version and working on reimplementing bug fix in new code.</p>

			 <p>Not quite sure how to word this prediction but padlet may have seen a down turn before the pandemic but it’s data mining free account luring will no doubt see more Universities and Colleges suckered into another shiny edutech purchase / subscription. All I can say is more due diligence is needed when picking tech. I do however fundamentally believe a spatial tool such as padlet has so many supportive options and opportunities for staff and students particularly in the area of design thinking and co-creation else I wouldn’t have been researching and making what is now becoming nodenogg.in for almost 6 or so years. If you happen to have been playing with padlet (Miro, mural, milanote) at a University or College recently please feel free to get in touch as I would love to hear more about how you have used padlet and what worked and what didn’t.</p>

			 <p>After 29 years tonight we return home back at Plough Lane. The FA said a new such as Wimbledon Town would not be in the wider interests of football when they approved the decision to rip Wimbledon FC from it community as the team and league place was stolen from its community and relocated over 70miles away. We started AFC Wimbledon, we regained our league place and today is another nail is an already shut tight case that the FA and the then owners of Wimbledon FC where utterly wrong.  We are fan owned and community focussed and we are back in the Heart of Wimbledon ⚽️ playing down the road in Kingston was a great place to be since 2002 but there’s no place like home!

			 <p>I probably need to blog about this properly but as a maker of a a “tool for thought” with a particular angle a spatial human computer interfaces (since 2014 😉) and Edutecg, I am very aware of all the recent huge VC investments in Miro ($50 million) Roam etc. ($9+ million / $200 million dollar valuation)</p>
<p>These Digital tools for sharing ideas are suddenly seen as one of the panaceas within our new lockdown life’s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miro is profitable and growing, with over 5 million users and 20,000 paying customers, including 80% of the Fortune 100.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Roam) have still managed to become one of the fastest companies in history to reach $1 million in annual recurring revenue. (Possible only 6000 users)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Brackets by me)</p>
<p>It’s clear these huge investments are about getting more people to that one service by using that money to add more features from other platforms or to draw all the experts to one place (Roam Makers programme) and in most cases surveil the people’s data even if there are paying or not. All in the hope that they come out of this owning “the tool” to rule all tools.</p>
<p>My tool is for small groups of people to work together to support each other in thinking through an idea. There are no user accounts and there is no centralised service. The code is free libre and you can reach out to me or build your own. I don’t hold “office hours” to win over academics or onboard new customers. I simply talk to people who might have an idea to make the web app work better for them.  Small tech that works for and is open (libre) to people is the way forward not tech with millions of users and monopoly dominance, that way only leads to the power balance continuing to tip to the corporations. You’ve all seen Bladerunner right?</p>
<p>Also Cory Doctorow evidences this much <a href="https://dctr.pro/2j3">better</a> me.</p>
<p>Need to get some more writing on researchnot.es ans feel free to look at <a href="https://alpha.adamprocter.co.uk">alpha.adamprocter.co.uk</a></p>

			 <p>Currently</p>
<ul>
<li>No. 3 in Top Movies in U.S. across Netflix.</li>
<li>No. 6 in Top 10 across all Netflix categories.</li>
</ul>
<p>And has gone “viral&quot; which is great and means more people will watch this film.</p>
<p>The film does a very good job of making concepts of surveillance capitalism and privacy infringement accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>Why not host a screening with those who are less likely to hear about the film. If you cant get together why not watch and the review over video call.</p>
<p>The film Interviews many well know technologists, designers and academics to discuss the design of social networks to the front of your thinking and neatly uses a drama like approach to show how the networks algorithms are designed to keep your attention for advertisers and the business models of the network and that this is not just an annoying feature of the product but a designed choice that shows that this in not good for us at all.</p>
<p>Remember the social networks have spent a lot of time convincing you they are they to <em>just</em> connect you to your friends, this is not true at all, they are there to connect you to the corporation first.</p>

Yeah <a href="https://micro.blog/evieirene">@evieirene</a> we can take your friends to Thorpe Park I have 50% off with RAC membership. No matter what I try System will not log me in, send in support ticket&hellip; nothing phone up and they can’t work it out so am told don’t worry call Thorpe Park, the first phone line is literally closed, instant message we are busy, second line I speak to someone who advises they no longer sell tickets over the phone, he can’t help. The website said best to use Twitter 🤦🏻‍♂️ &hellip; I tried. Phone back RAC was escalated and promised a call back &hellip; neither RAC got back to me and no replies at all on twitter.

			 <p>This morning <a href="https://micro.blog/dajbelshaw@fosstodon.org">@dajbelshaw@fosstodon.org</a>  shared this link <a href="http://dctr.pro/2j1">Google Has a Plan to Disrupt the College Degree</a></p>
<p>Even the full URL naming felt like click bait</p>
<blockquote>
<p>google-plan-disrupt-college-degree-university-higher-education-certificate-project-management-data-analyst.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably ? or at the very least just about SEO..</p>
<p>The title click bait ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Has a Plan to Disrupt the College Degree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say so. The Subtitle&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s new certificate program takes only six months to complete, and will be a fraction of the cost of college</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% click bait.</p>
<p>💥 <strong>Save time, save money, get “smart”</strong> 🤦</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by stating there is no way a 6 month programme is the equivalent of a 3 / 4 year degree programme.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>teach foundational skills that can help job-seekers immediately find employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This initial quote sums it up for me. Foundational skills for immediate employment but then Kent Walker senior vice president of global affairs at Google states;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our own hiring, we will now treat these new career certificates as the equivalent of a four-year degree for related roles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is those that started in UX design moved into these roles as they appeared, they had degrees in design, art or english. They adapted as the industry moved they used far more than foundational skills to negotiate changes. I&rsquo;ve been to talks from the games industry advocating the ‘fact’ you could learn to make a game via Google usually from individuals with degrees in English, philosophy, art or design even, and yet you don’t need a degree.  This tends to be a narrow-minded view of new courses, they somehow think that a course called Games Design is not a ‘proper' degree anyway and not the route into industry. The motivation is usually to accelerate people into current roles and lower costs.</p>
<p>Now for sure if you want to work on Fortnite 2, or any version of any game you can see now. You could get up to speed in 6 months in one very thin aspect of game making say basic 3d modelling and you could possibly get a ground level role if the company recognises the credentials, your portfolio would be very limited. I am not confident this would actually work in practice mind.</p>
<p>However if it does I am also confident your starting wage and positions would be much lower than one of my graduates and your progression in the industry would be much slower.</p>
<p>Why can I say this, two fold, I have the data to back this up but also a degree programme is not teaching you how to do a job role.  And if it isn&rsquo;t obvious the ‘jobs’ are always changing and evolving. Some roles our graduates are in didn&rsquo;t exist 6 months ago.</p>
<p>In teaching a degree programme, we have what I like to call a lens. In my instance our lens is game making, I think it&rsquo;s a pretty important lens for many reasons, which can be found elsewhere on my blog, or just ask me why games are the most important design medium of our time, however it is still a lens. So within that Lens we are helping students to undertake what is wrapped in the package often called Life Long Learning.</p>
<p>Some of the items in that package include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Resilience</li>
<li>Cooperation</li>
<li>Co-creation</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Context</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Negotiation</li>
<li>Future thinking</li>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Failing</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
<li>Society</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside all of these and more is the design, writing, psychology and technical skills to manifest ideas through game making, which is another huge list. And when I talk about skills there is again a specific way to really learn skills, my ZX Spectrum skills dont serve me today but the way I understood them does.</p>
<p>This is a holistic approach to learning and how to work within a complex evolving system (our world). We do this with 3 to 4 years of project based learning, industry and exchange placements, projects and internships. MIT refers to this rather neatly as the four Ps - Projects, Passion, Peers and Play.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t cover this type of approach in a 6 month programme, whose central pillar is to get you a job role. Yes perhaps those that progress from the 6 months (crash) course may in a company likely learn a lot of what I describe above on the job but would that the best place and of course you run the risk of being let go for any ‘mistakes’ you may make.</p>
<p>Walker then pulls out a patriotic flag to tug at our heart strings;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need new, accessible job-training solutions &hellip; to help America recover and rebuild.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be misled these courses are Google training programmes for Google to drive down the wages of designers and engineers.</p>
<p>These two lines are just nonsense;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Higher education has been ripe for disruption for a long time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that Google’s move;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… has major potential to change the future of education and work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh Please !</p>
<p>Yes short vocational courses have there place but let’s understand that properly and have a real discussion on how we need a decent mixed economy of education rather than the ongoing diatribe of Silicon Valley disruption.</p>
<p>This next quote for me is dangerous;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember: Nowadays, it&rsquo;s all about skills. Not degrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A degree is not about getting a job at Apple, Google or IBM per se. This is the ongoing fundamental miss-understanding of education. What Google have created is a training programme not an education.</p>
<p>The world has some of the most unprecedented issues the human race has ever faced, what we don’t need is more of the same skills,  we actually need more curiosity &amp; creativity, and I know where this thrives, in Design, Art and Humanities education.</p>
<p>(yes I used the same click bait title - sorry 🤪)</p>

			 <p>Your chance to join the debate on football, climate-change and sustainability. Point 10 from the Yellow and Blue Plan / Manifesto.</p>
<p>19 August at 6.30pm the inaugural Yellow and Blue Discussion Series asks a series of fundamental questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can football afford to be ethical?</li>
<li>Is there an economic model that can make the ethical profitable?</li>
<li>In a world full of financial uncertainty, can AFC Wimbledon truly afford to be environment-friendly and sustainable?</li>
<li>Should caring about the future of our planet be part of football and AFC Wimbledon’s USP?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions and more will be put under the spotlight in the second of the Yellow and Blue Discussion Series by a high-profile panel of experts. The panel will also take questions from the audience.</p>
<p>On the panel are:</p>
<p>Lucy Siegle, renowned journalist and broadcaster, reporter for the One Show, and founder of the Observer Ethical awards</p>
<p>Dr. Russell Seymour, Chief Executive of the British Association for Sustainable Sport, and Sustainability Manager at Lords Cricket Ground</p>
<p>Paul Jeater, Chair of the Eastern Region of the Green Party and author of the Unique Solution: The first year of AFC Wimbledon</p>

			 <p>Disclaimer have not read up on the legal details of Epic v mobile stores.</p>
<p>I run &amp; teach game design at a UK University and have been an Apple fan since the 90s and a “gamer” even before that. (I was good on the Amiga but am terrible on most PS4 games)</p>
<p>What I would say is that this is just about money and it was always going to be a big game company to take this on. The simple fact is that over the last decade the fastest growing gaming platform has and is mobile, it’s the biggest sector more than all other platforms now (has been for a few years if I recall correctly) and this is inside the biggest entertainment industry on the planet. Games out sell month on month music and film combined &amp; not by small margins either, the pandemic has accelerated the growth which is year on year huge (9.3% last year). You think any gaming company is just going to hand 30% over for providing nothing.</p>
<p>AR is going to be a big gaming area and Apple are already showing the most capable place to use this tech. That’s total lock down for these game companies Apple will have to change its model.</p>
<p>The Apple Arcade deals are obviously not good enough or not a right fit as “no in app purchases” - I have my own thoughts on how Apple Arcade should work to support indie games mind but that’s another blog post.</p>
<p>On mobile In-game revenues are the main source of income, with nearly 98% of the $77.2 billion in revenues coming from in-game transactions in 2020. It’s also worth noding towards some of the social aspects re games like Fortnite in that is not just a last person standing game it’s the equivalent of the skateparks we use to hang out as teenagers so your style (look) and presence in game is very important and thus custom avatar purchase or prizes etc are really important to these communities.</p>
<p>I am not sure if using your players and mobilising them to bash Apple via social media is an ethical approach however as I am confident Epics motivation is all about revenue no matter what they say in the law suite.</p>
<p>What I want the argument to actually be about is the control of how we can use our devices is exercised on us and as these devices are clear extensions of ourselves, we are already cyborgs, augmented by the mobile technology and yet we are being given less and less control over our digital selves &amp; thus our digital human rights.</p>
<p>Apple might well just start cutting more deals with big companies and then we will have truly lost.</p>

			 <p>Nice I needed more space to reply to your nice mention and thanks for the links, the flow chart one I will certainly look at, one for research and two because I was looking for a tool like that.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/humanetech@mastodon.social">@humanetech@mastodon.social</a> @dajbelshaw yes makes sense when I was looking at the list, was wondering about an education or learning section, as one of the problematics I hope to help continue to expose (in the text part of my PhD) is the infiltration of surveillance into education tech by default and why this is not humane - @audreywatters has written much more on this than me mind <a href="http://hackeducation.com/">hackeducation.com</a> - my project is certainly much like a FOSS miro but the design is specifically aimed to work in augmenting a education art/design studio co-creation process, a key factor I have found in testing and working with students over the last 15+ years is that when working together in this way unlike every screen shot on miros site it works best when contribution are anonymous, this may not last in the session, as working with small groups (up to 25) people can identify themselves or it may becomes obvious but it enables a flattening of hierarchy and reduces some of the anxiety of having to &ldquo;look good&rdquo; in front of your peers and tutors, which in turn results in better exploration of an idea. We have also ised nodenogg.in a number of times to open up dialog just prior to a presentation or deadline which also had surprising anxiety reduction benefits, this is all being documented in the PhD text</p>

			 <p>As most people <em>should</em> know I am working on a practice based PhD (my research for now) that revolves around open practice researchnot.es and making, testing the Free Open Source Software project I have been building for supporting specific co-creation activities in design education/practice, nodenogg.in. At the start of this year the faculty suggested I could get a laptop as part of my PhD, although I am in faculty, and so I have a machine for work (MacBook Pro 2019) but I do also pay half my fees so I jumped at the chance at the potential for some other hardware. This wasnt quiet the case and I had to use some of my internal &ldquo;kick back&rdquo; funds to pay but after a long delay, however the machine arrived today. There was lots of reasons for the delay checking funding, covid etc but the big piece and the only reason I needed any additional hardware was the was also getting sign of to be able to install a Linux Distribution on University supplied hardware, I had to sign off that I would not want support and agreement for my webscience and design PhD supervisors that it was a legit request. University process is painful sometimes !</p>
<p>Due to numerous aspects of my research work - open, ethical, inclusive and delightful. I had gotten to the point where needed to properly consider, understand and undertake development on the open platform of Linux and also I wanted to use Pop!_ OS which was a Linux distribution that looked to have been working on UX /UI for a while, Aral Balkan and Doug Belshaw had mentioned it a number of time. I had thus previously run Pop! on a VMware but I didn&rsquo;t really use it as it was a VM and I was already on my main machine running macOS.  I had attempted a simular approach with a USB-C SSD drive hooked to my mac but that didnt work. I knew I needed seperate hardware that I could use as a main machine to really test out.</p>
<p>I had not asked for any specific hardware just something that would run the Pop! system. So today a Dell Latitude Intel i5 8th Gen 1.60GHz , 8GB ram, 500gb SSD, intel, Radeon 540X Series graphic 14&quot; laptop arrived at my house (we now have home delivery due to covid-19), I was in meetings most of the day so my wife took the parcel in. I messaged the IT team to check if I needed to do anything special to install another OS, this unfortunatly meant they had to come back and turn of the BIOS password, I couldnt even log into the system with the Universiry field machine set up anyway.</p>
<p>Ok with the BIOS disabled I used Etcher.io to put the live OS onto a USB stick, this was hurdle one as my mac had not been set to allow this app to have the right level permissions to mount and unmount disks, I ended up running the App via sudo from terminal which forced the issue, I suspect I could have just edited security settings in Preferences but the error was not very clear it was a permission issue. The writer process has quit unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Once permissions where updated the USB stick was ready. I plugged this in to the Dell and duck duck go searched USB boot Dell to find out how to chooise a boot device, which advised pressing f12, the Pop! website had I read on said laptops would use f1 or f7, which was not the case. f12 worked but I checked this twice as to make sure I was seeing the USB device as it appeared twice in the list. So I selected the USB stick and it restarted followed by small white text on the background which said &ldquo;You need to load the kernel first&rdquo; and nothing happened. I searched this error and it seemed I needed to turn of secure boot, I had seen this was on previously. I was happy to edit the bios settings and so disabled secure boot, which did also sent me on a bit of a deadend reboot once when it tried to restarted into the pre installed windows, this was not allowed and I entered something called BitRecovery. Which was a little concerned as it was asking for codes and I was worried I would lock myself out but I managed to navigate a reboot and get back into the f12 boot and tried again.</p>
<p>This time I was presented with the test or install Pop message and a reboot count down. The screen the went blank and stayed blank, I waited and waited as I assumed it maybe slow from the USB stick but nothing happened. A further search suggested it maybe to do with UEFI bios mode and that I should switch to legacy boot mode, this option was not present but I noticed on the offical pop install screenshots it said UEFI so I concluded it must be something else. I was concerned my GPU was prehaps not supported, and there was a lot of talk about rufus mode (no idea). I then found a post that had another line that advised when you see the visual test and install Pop prompt you should press the letter e and the following line should say gfxpayload=text. When I entered the special e location I saw gfxplayload=keep, I edited this and hit Ctrl-X. This time after counting down the reboot displayed line after lines of thinking happening and then the install screen appeared &hellip; progress!</p>
<p>Pop then installed no problem, I didnt encypt the drive, the setup was simple to follow and I was worried about the keyboard as I am very use to @ being on the number 2, and was plesantly suprised I could pick UK machintosh keyboard layout and test it out, as my muscle memory is going to struggle anought with CTRL over CMD, I might see if I can remap some other options, Super (the &ldquo;windows&rdquo; key) + /  for search for example is testing my cmd + space to open alfred however I set up my user no problem and a little later on I was promoted for some dell/ system updates including firmware update to 1.7.5 which I think suggested I can enable Secure Boot again (not sure why I need it yet mind).</p>
<p>Firefox was preinstalled and so I logged into my Firefox account which was great. I then opened the Pop!_ Shop to install VSCode and others, I searched and installed VSCode but it wasnt the official one so that was confusing, but easily rectified. I then went to get Obsidian and both files I downloaded a snap and an appimage didnt just install either like an exe or like macOS (drag and drop from an disk image), It offered to search the store but turned up no results, I then looked online to install GitKraken which also offered a number of installs again this was confusing too but it also said Snap Store, so I decided that this store might be the best approach, I was then able to use terminal to install snap and the then desktop snap store,at first I didnt think the snap desktop store had installed but a restart, as advised in one guide fixed this, and enabled me to install Gitkraken and an Apple Music client (a browser wrapper, althought it also asked to installa DRM app and yet didnt work for play back, but neither did logging in via firefox)</p>
<p>The obsidian snap app was not on the store and when I tried to use terminal to install I was presented with a warning error: cannot find signatures with metadata for snap, so another search later and I added the line &ndash;dangerous and it installed. I also installed Syncthing from the Pop Shop. This added a folder called Sync, I went to check out the webpage which also suggests installing a GTK, GUI for Syncthing, the Pop Shop had this but again like the unofficial VS Code it is labeled as flathub flatpak, I searched the store again and found the Debian build? It seems to be working. I have to connect my two devices now my mac and Pop! I want to do this so I can use Obsidian to write on both machines. I will do some testing again conflicting files as well as I know Obsidian are looking to launch there own sync service but that is not out yet and another monthly subscription. I installed Filezilla, last on my to do although, Apple Music was a diversion, and needs fixing / deleting and Iam a little concerned about the extra thing it installed, I did download Discord as I think I will want to connect that but only to my own discord.</p>
<p>I keep rolling my mouse to the left to get the activities dock to appear, on macOS my dock is visible on the left, and I need to work out how to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; windows. Of to read up on the shortcuts, so far seems very nice and the machine itself seem nice to use and the screen although not retina is bright and clear. Spellcheck in firefox doesnt seem to be working in the micro.blog web posting text area.</p>
<p>Most of the above wasnt painful but it wasnt seemless and installing apps was a little triicky if not in the Pop Shop and installing the Snap Shop involved terminal. If I was buying a machine I would look at the Pinebooks, I have not read up if they work with Pop, I should expect so.</p>
<p>n.b Apple Music started worked CONTENT_EQUIVALENT error was an Apple issue, will work out if the extra DRM thing for Apple Music is bad or not at some point.</p>

<p>Synchronization is the precise coordination of multiple events. In computing, it refers to the coordination of hardware devices, such that the data they contain or provide is made to be identical. - Computerhope.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know a number of people who I follow and maybe follow me on micro.blog are into text editors, and I know some have made reference to Tot App and even connecting it to org-roam BUT I must thus warn people that the app Tot for macOS, iOS does a terrible thing in the way it handles sync, in that it doesn’t sync it just overwrites, I will not link to twitter but the replies to my friend <a href="https://micro.blog/mrmurphy">@mrmurphy</a> after losing a ton of offline work are “Last write wins&quot; , no apologies and when queried where this is spelt out in the apps marketing the reply was “it&rsquo;s implied - it&rsquo;s a marketed as a simple scratchpad, not a document management tool”. You cannot offer a text based app that claims to have &ldquo;seamless sync&rdquo; if this is destructive overwriting, that is not sync that is brute force. Yes Sync is hard and many apps handle this with human decision based conflict resolution, I spent a long time looking into how I would use realtime sync with CouchDB and PouchDB and a huge part of this is the system cannot lose anyones data and should in fact have histories and such, etherpad being a wonderful example. I was hoping after our latest <a href="https://uneducators.org">uneducators.org</a> podcast (minus 11) which was a little railroaded by Chris&rsquo;s rightful upset at losing a lot of work, I had hoped to have a happy ending but it got worse, no sympathy, just a note on how to get a refund, the app is £20 and the way they sell free on macOS and £20 on iOS implies Sync. They don’t know what Sync is.</p>

			 <p>I’ve seen it. I’m sure you have. Comments that advise a Degree in Fine Art, Games Design, Fashion, Media Production or Animation is not a real Degree and that these Mickey Mouse courses are a waste of time.</p>
<p>Often followed with cries that this could all be learnt on Google. Coupled with a mockery of students that wish to undertake such courses, as taking the easy route and not wanting to get a “job”.</p>
<p>Yet embedded at the core of all of these types of programmes, at the centre of Art Schools is creative investigation, problem solving, design thinking, innovative solutions, products and growing resilience.</p>
<p>So when I look around the world today and even more so right now I see the requirement for these types of thinkers and makers in all sectors of the economy.</p>

			 <p>This is in reply to <a href="https://micro.blog/thoughtshrapnel">@thoughtshrapnel</a>&rsquo;s recent Saturday update and I wanted to publish my reply to my site.</p>
<p>Here is the original newsletter - <a href="https://dctr.pro/2hm">dctr.pro/2hm</a></p>
<p>Excellent couple of education related links in the newletter this saturday and nice commentary from Doug (as ever). I have been thinking about this stuff too (obviously),  I talk about some of it in the fledgling <a href="https://uneducators.org">uneducators</a> podcast and my own musings on micro.blog.</p>
<p>Also prompted by this article to think specifically in terms of change versus opportunity, this to me is that the hand is (finally) being forced and change in our delivery of HE is long overdue. I found a blog post from over 5 years ago I wrote and have notes / ideas going back a decade or more on progressive approaches to HE and tech. I am not the only one that has been doing this in the various Technology Enhanced / Digital Education committees, workgroups etc. there have been many of us, but we had been seen as &lsquo;innovators&rsquo; or people that &lsquo;understand&rsquo; technology, and probably worse, even with &lsquo;senior staff&rsquo; on these spaces not much happened, little pilots here and there but it was always seen as &lsquo;radical&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I recall when being a &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; was laughed upon, I look back on that time and smile, I always loved being a &lsquo;nerd&rsquo; , curiosity is the key to creative thinking.</p>
<p>What we must be aware of is learner &lsquo;analytics&rsquo; and big data. Especially when those conversations come from Valley based startups or those modelling themselves on the Valleys buisness model.</p>
<p>And finally how dare a &lsquo;Professor&rsquo; say that to a 17year old, but then again I recall my art teacher at high school making similar discouraging comments&hellip;</p>

I also did a number of other exciting foundation work today so to get yourself listed as a supporter ASAP just head to <a href="https://nodenogg.in">nodenogg.in</a> and tap the support link and show you were here from day one (well ok technical there have been a lot of days but I won’t hold that against you!) by supporting for as little as £1 per month you will be onboard one of the revolutionary products that will rise very much so after COVID-19. 💥 🤯</p>

			 <p>Covid-19 will change the way we deliver education. True Blended learning will be a de-facto standard for all education and not the experimental or niche that some “old school” educators continue to see it as. The need to be savvy with digital tools will be as important as subject specialism. This will enforce that educators are also capable technologists. No longer will anyone be able to hide behind a so called technical ignorance or annoyance. This does mean we need to also be very aware right now of the claws that Silicon Valley edutech will be deploying to capitalise on the capitalism approach to education and that we educators and tool builders must resist and fight against. We must be vigilant if we have any hope to save education from the ongoing marketisation and monopolisation based on purely ecomonic gains. I will try to write more on this but needed to post brief realisation / summary.</p>

<p>Today there are approximately 2.6 Billion people playing video Games. This group is not just men, in fact it is a really diverse audience. This group is almost evenly split in terms of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->gender<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (52% identify as female in last major survey in 2014). When you dive into some of the detail we see areas where there are, for example more middle age women playing video Games than teenage boys (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nesta 2017<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). This clearly indicates the appetite for game types is also in fact very <!-- raw HTML omitted -->diverse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Games are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->biggest<!-- raw HTML omitted --> consumed media on the planet now and so this means they have the capacity to do more than just entertain. They can enable social good (Pokemon Go Earth day Clean up), produce empathy around migration (Papers Please) , Cancer (That Dragon Cancer) or give insight into Mental health (Hellblade: Senua&rsquo;s Sacrifice). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Creative Review<!-- raw HTML omitted --> suggests Games are the future of storytelling and so to speak and tackle broad issues and audiences through this medium we must have a group of diverse makers.</p>
<p>It is worth noting this is often not the way main stream media portrays Games. They tend to focus on the same types of titles and genres, which also has an impact on the understanding of game. Or worse. We must work to combat this stereotyping.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Guardian is an excellent example of opposition to this with Games featured under <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Culture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and not under entertainment or toys for example.</p>
<p>So we know there is diverse audience and diverse players but those working in the “Games industry” are still predominantly white men. The workforce in the UK identifies as 28% female and 20% worldwide. This is a complex and multi-faceted issue but is in part due to the wider issue of Technology, Engineering and Computer Science having the same issues.  Some of the historical context of this largely lies around the marketing of technology in the 1980s with a focus on these things being for boys and we know that Schools and marketing still skew that interest in technology.</p>
<p>A great example of a product that is already combating this within Engineering and girls is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GoldieBlox<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the argument that there is any biological difference is factually incorrect, data from across the world in fact shows girls out performing boys in science tests in fact, and yet there interest in the Science Technology Engineering and maths (STEM) subjects drops at around 15 years old and never recovers.</p>
<p>GoldieBlox uses storytelling with STEM principles as extensive testing with girls showed this type of interaction appealed much more to girls than for example Lego&rsquo;s attempts in this regard by just making the boxes pink.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The voices of many people are needed to create great and compelling Games for all people and the powerful potential of Games to unite people can only be unlocked if we have a diverse representation of people making these products. Why would any industry not want to have diversity?</p>
<p>Can we make it change? The stats are already showing a rise of diversity in the Games industries themselves and in the diversity of makers but there is much work to be done which starts at Schools and Universities. This includes educating against discrimination, encouraging participation and showcasing role models.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From the inception of the course at WSA we knew based on the industry and are position, we wanted to and where in a place to encourage diversity into making Games. We understood the power Games would have and where Games where heading, although already a huge industry in 2013, the direction of future travel was very exciting, we are really only just seeing the impact of this exciting medium. The V&amp;A in 2019 called Games design one of the most significant design fields of our time.</p>
<p>Connected to this concept we knew and had working knowledge of the game engine Unity. The engine was well established and was well on its way to achieve its goal of democratising game making.</p>
<p>It had been doing this as its focus was on creativity, it has an editor that was powerful yet visual and including things such as simple drag and drop capabilities, this meant many more people could just start to quickly realise an idea without a focus on the technology. Unity is all about bringing ideas to life, without a focus on how great the technology is but a focus on enabling creativity. Something like Media Molecules Dreams is probably the next phase in the arena of what has been coined in the past as Game 3.0.</p>
<p>Also having taught coding and interaction design skills to students within an Art School for well over 10 years I was also acutely aware of how off putting coding can be for anyone who wants to be creative, it can be very stifling, and a barrier to entry. This is often because of a focus on the technology rather than the manifestation of the idea or intent through the use of appropriate media.</p>
<p>I had personally seen with my background in interaction design, the alienation of women, at events and online and I have 3 daughters whom I encouraged to do whatever they were passionate about yet saw and heard discouraging comments around what is for girls and what is for boys.</p>
<p>With all this in mind we developed a course that uses design thinking and making through the lens of Games to tell stories, provide emotional moments and more. We didn’t focus on technology and we didn’t focus on only video Games, we focussed on research, ideas and manifesting them in game artefacts.</p>
<p>We knew this would draw diverse people to the course, also by situating our course within WSA, the University of Southampton’s Art School and not within the Computer Science Faculty we could really push the way we teach Games and the approach of what Games are. These opportunities allowed the creation of a unique course of study situated within Games.</p>
<p>What we do in our course is some simple but deliberate things, we make very sure all our decisions include diversity. And so we look to feature that diversity by making active and conscious design choices with any of our processes and outputs to ensure there is diverse representation. Students work in teams and we mix them up for each project, considering their background alongside their current skillsets.</p>
<p>We as a team of staff and of our students are also made aware of the unconscious bias that can creep into our every day life and so we take deliberate actions to combat this. This can be as simple as adapting the language we use. We make sure all of our text is gender neutral and we actively seek out and test this with our students, even this blog post was discussed with our current year 3 students to see if this was accurate and agreeable to them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At open days and interview days we ensure a diversity of students are represented from Games on campus. This we know that has a direct impacts on ensuring diverse recruitment, students have stated that this is what enabled them to see themselves at WSA studying Games, because they see someone like them. This is often coupled with the realisation they have every right to want to make Games as anyone else.</p>
<p>We are careful to pick media and outputs that do not reinforce the stereotypical idea of Games, for example our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->course film<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has conscious efforts to showcase diversity. All of our open day and external talks mention and talk about diversity in Games, and we select Games that people may not have heard of and talk about the why of the Games more than the how. These actions we know has direct impact on our recruitment diversity. We have always had a close affiliation with Women in Games UK and Vanissa our year one tutor is an ambassador, alongside a number of Alumni winning Women in Games Awards. We then make sure we promote these types of activities and awards on our social media and websites.</p>
<p>Each year we make sure to invite a diverse range of speakers to provide guest input into the course, with an active part of their day spent talking to students about their own experiences and discussion the students own projects, this adds to feeling part of a real community. For example over the last year we have had guests including, Minkette an Escape room designer, Emma Reay a researcher looking at Games scholarship and children&rsquo;s literature scholarship and Lucy Kyriakidou a freelance 2d game artist.  We think about every choice we make to showcase diversity and this in turn combats the issue of diversity in Games. Showing role models and inspirational people. We want to create a course that is inclusive as we know that there are many artists and designers that want to use the medium of Games to inspire and enrich others, just as it has for them and we want to show that this is possible and that there is a way in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A key is to write projects that will have broad appeal and provide excellent learning, so we create and encourage projects within our modules that talk to or are about themes and ideas, not about the technology or the skills directly. We then embed as necessary technology and skills within the thinking and research but the driver is not the technology. This appeals to designers and artists from different backgrounds and is less intimidating for anyone than say a bunch of technology jargon or buzzwords. As an example you could have a project on Virtual Reality (VR) or instead you could have a project that looks at why humans have been obsessed with the idea of immersion since the Victorians. One offers a narrow view and uses technology that lots of women see as horribly designed and not designed for them, the other offers opportunities to consider VR from many points of view, both projects would culminate in a VR experience but the differences would be dramatic.  We know many young girls are playing Games and have a love for Games and so we want to show that not only can they consume these Games but they could be making them, this is the only way we address and bring diversity to the Games industries.</p>
<p>The effects of this work have been measured in our recruitment which is very different to the vast majority of institutes that currently offer Games course;</p>
<p>For context
Female percentage in current cohort;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Female percentage of our Alumni graduates;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Across the University of Southampton a lot of good work being done generally to encourage women into STEAM (A for Art). We have the Women in Science and Technology + group, which now crosses into humanities and runs many cross faculty projects. We have specific competitions that call for participation from underrepresented groups, alongside celebrating and connecting our work to days that celebrate role models such as Ada Lovelace. One year on International Women’s day, I arrived at WSA to find the Games studio walls plastered with images of women from the Games industry with quotes about their achievements, we never took them down. The University is active in upholding the standards of the Athena Swan charter and is a member of the race and equality charter.  The Games industry is generally very welcoming and supportive of diversity and is a welcoming community and is general fully committed to addressing the issue of diversity, and so we do see positive change, with a growth in the number of women in Games, it is probably too slow but it is growing.</p>
<p>All of the above has to be done as an active consideration of what you do, there is an issue with diversity in Games and this is not ok. The UK Games industry needs to do much more work to fund and support diverse game making, for an industry worth more than music and film combined (globally) it should do more in this regard, I would like to see nationwide schemes to provide funding to more of the indie makers, there are still to many stories of how great game makers had to work numerous jobs to fund Games that have huge value to society. On a smaller scale Games companies and educators should consider everything they do from how you design your studio space, how you write you course curriculum and how you promote your activities.</p>
<p>Ask yourself does this have the potential to feed a stereotype, if so stop and change what it is. Games are for every player and so we need makers of every type. Promote diversity wherever possible, as the male dominated position has had enough promotion.</p>

This spells out how you could loan money to The Dons Trust and gain decent interest over a 5,10 or 20 year period. With these Bonds, you can achieve a financial return while helping AFC Wimbledon and the Dons Trust get the new community stadium completed in time for the 2020-21 season and preserve the fan-owned status of the club. We are a unique club with a unique history and ownership model designed to support the broader community. This new community stadium will have a huge impact on how much we can support people in and around Wimbledon. It&rsquo;s more than Football, the AFC Wimbledon Foundation supports, Sport, Health, Education and Inclusion in various out reach activities, this new community stadium would be a focal point for this and allow more to be done.

			 <p>This is a difficult bug to consider but going to post here and then log in the system… the remote CouchDB has died but the server is up so when trying to connect the 502 gateway error causes a CORS errors. But you can still proceed into nodenogg.in (as its PouchDB) and works offline. I can test this by going offline and entering a microcosm but now it seems the list and spatial views do not update visually so you cant see your data. If you go back online and wait the page will update, the data will sync and nothing was lost and all your notes captured and visible, but not being able to see the local copy is wrong now. Shows how robust the offline mode is but I must be showing the wrong data set now or something.</p>

			 <p>As a AFC Wimbledon fan a core of why I love the Club and set up is our Trust / Fans owned model. So counter to the greed and cash driven situation of most top flight UK clubs. This model of ownership means that we the fans and the community guide and steer the club to benefit the community, be it those directly connected to football or just by enabling our stars to visit and encouraged kids at hospitals and other community areas we can bring positivity. BUT right now we have a huge capital funding gap (£11million) to finish  our brandnew community stadium. So here is how you can help.</p>
<p>You can invest into the newly announced bond scheme and gain a great intrest rate of up to 4%! (there is some risks obviously) but Please check out the <a href="https://ploughlanebond.com/">Bond website</a> for details on how you could help realise the final piece in the puzzle a stadium back in Wimbledon and this great community asset for Wimbledon whilst also having a very nice interest rate on your savings.</p>

			 <p>I had not seen this video before. With Hindsight it appears Ed Leek was clearly keen to sell out the club as he talked about changes to the ownership option being a restricted action and a need to change it. Again with Hinsight it also appears he knew a lot more than we the owners did. Also clearly his ambition is bigger means better. I assume he is still co-opt’d onto the AFC PLC board too. I personally would like to see a motion to remove Ed Leek and Mark Davis from the DTB urgently, very disappointed.</p>

			 <p>Like a few AFC Wimbledon fans there is a number of people that have said well you’ve gone as far as you can with the fans model you need an investor who will plough money in year after year.</p>
<p>People said that to me when we where in the Combined Counties League. Yet we continued to rise and rise and we did it by balancing the books.  This blog post puts a much better view on the finances and how we have always been prudent with our day to days funds. <a href="https://dctr.pro/2gf">dctr.pro/2gf</a></p>
<p>Co-operative ownership of a Football club is still possible and can be run well however we currently have a huge capital funding gap which appears to have not been foreseen and we agreed to leave our current stadium without the guarantee that the new one will be completed, something we agreed not to do.</p>
<p>I am not sure how this has all really happened and I feel a number of the DTB have made major mistakes, however we should not be pursuing external take over (investment) just to plug the gap.</p>
<p>Yes I think we need to make some major changes to the way we operate the club to best support the Dons Trust Board, such as bringing in paid positions to support their work, after a completed re-election however, and I think we need to do much more work on corporate sponsorship.</p>
<p>Yes the shell stadium I think will be a nightmare to start but lets think progressively, can we set up local vans for food and drinks, like a box park, can we lean on some of our unique points and set up sustainable ways to finance finishing the stadium. I spoke to the Dons Trust tent on the weekend and made it clear I will not be bringing my family to a club taken over by individuals and I wasn’t the only one on the family section that agreed with me, this is a community club and needs to be owned by the community to give the best possible future for the community.</p>
<p>The Dons Trust Board need to stop wasting time talking about theses invisible investors, tell us what you are doing and sure why not just tell us who wants to take over our club but stop the road show of non information please.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The background noise at AFC Wimbledon and The Dons Trust board this week has been insane.  I fully support the Open letter sent to the Football Club Board and Dons Trust Board. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1txcjrS8djG4Cmux0_-Xl5S708x4JOaof/view">Open Letter</a></p>
<p>We (AFC Wimbledon) are a fans owned club, and are about to move to a new stadium (back) at Plough Lane, we had various levels of communication and meetings as to what this means and some hints towards costing the project and from what I gleaned over the last few years was this all seemed good, our main hurdles where permissions, many unfounded objections that slowed the project and the work of demolition of the old Grey Hound stadium.  It was advised there would be a share issue, a loan, crowd funding and such. All seemed to be moving on and we had recently raised just shy of £2.5 million via crowd funding through <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/afcwimbledon/sections/investors">Seedrs</a>, I was waiting for my email to send details from my custom named brick. But then out of the blue we (the fans) are advised the club is struggling to get a bank loan needed and thus we haven’t been allowed to sign the final financial contract for the building works (although this has started). And we are advised we are £11million short.</p>
<p>The way to plug this gap is outlined in a number of options, which is then reported differently to <a href="https://thedonstrust.org/2019/11/25/vital-meetings-coming-up/">Dons Trust members</a> via members documents (I don&rsquo;t think are shareable) from the Dons Trust Board and then as a <a href="https://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news/2019/november/club-statement/">Club statement</a>. The wording seems to give the strong suggestion that we need to take external investment which from the way it is presented would only be accepted by those parties if we make changes to our ownership model.</p>
<p>I support this open letter as a Dons Trust member whole heartily. I am not prepared to vote for external investment that impacts the current model of the fans co-operative having the majority of control. I would rather we are relegated and have a smaller stadium than pass over majority ownership or control to an individual or group of investors.</p>
<p>I am worried about what appears to me as assurance over the last few years that we could afford this new stadium and now we are told that is not longer correct. I understand costs have gone up thanks to the numerous delays from a host of terrible protests against the building works. But the indication was this was all in hand and more importantly understood.</p>
<p>From the start things appeared to had all been costed sensibly from what I read and heard from Dons Trust Board meetings &amp; the Club. I am a little confused as to what has actually gone wrong.</p>
<p>My own preference at this stage would be that we seek what the club statement has as option 1 to secure a loan as close to £11million and look to alternative models of investment to reduce and pay back that loan ASAP and keep the ownership the same. I understand obtaining a loan of this value has proved very difficult however there is plenty of different buisness models that a progressive football club could undertake and the old model of big external investment must be seen as not working. Do I need to mention Bolton or Bury?</p>
<p>If the majority ownership is not with the fans I would have to do some serious thinking. The model of UK football clubs with investors and money is dreadful and I don&rsquo;t want my Club to be run with that in mind even if that appears at this time to forfeit a possible future role in the top league in the UK. No one thought we would get this far with this model. No one thought we could do what we have done. We must not throw the towel in at the last hurdle just to get the bigger stadium via external funding only.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping for more details and better consultation on this issue. Once beyond this we need to get more background and details as to what has gone wrong and how we look at the accountability and reporting from the Dons Trust Board and Football Club Board.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday … Meeting with my design based PhD Supervisor and you tell him all the cool stuff you’ve been building which doesn’t sounds that cool when you say it out loud and of course he mentions the thing you had put off all day as you built the “vital” reader view component “I really want to see your writing on this stuff” and so the next morning you decide that you must in fact properly start writing up the number of testing sessions already undertaken now direct to my researchnot.es blog and then you spend half the morning trying to work out why your wordpress wont connect to your discourse properly. I wonder if this is how Manton has been feeling about his book too, cant wait till its out though&hellip; just saying!   Wordpress, Discourse all working now so I am getting there, first post in a while has gotten quite technical but I think worth dipping into with each post even on the usage testing front, as the choices are very much human centred.</p>

			 <p>More good news for my fav game Engine Godot. Heroic labs are a platinum sponsor <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/heroic-labs-supports-godot-development">LINK</a></p>
<p>In the announcement Heroic labs founder Mo Firouz makes some great comments too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was lucky. I grew up in a country and a time where people did their gaming on computers, rather than consoles. Commodore Amigas, Atari STs, and early PCs made it easy to learn the ropes of game development in accessible languages like BASIC. That meant the path from gamer to game developer was inexpensive and usually free.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, open source game development tools do a similar job. They help everyone –– from indie developers to AAA studios –– to focus on creating the best game rather than having to rebuild a physics engine, shift graphics blobs manually in memory, or develop reliable back-end infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Stephen Downes is always finding great stuff and has a knack to see aross disciplines and see how together new things may form. In his latest publication <a href="https://dctr.pro/2ff">A Look At The Future Of Open Educational Resources</a>  towards the end he states;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third and finally, designers and developers will need to learn to co-create cooperatively. This is not the same as collaboration, where small or large teams work on a certain product or outcome. Cooperative work involves multiple individuals and groups working within a common environment or infrastructure, and helping support that network or infrastructure for mutual benefit, while working on different objectives or outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of this involves building and sharing resources in common. But an equally large part of it involves being able to work in the open, or as it is sometimes called, ‘open working’. Examples exist in, say, the philosophy of ‘open science’, where “many of the benefits envisaged for open methods relate to how far they enable not only access but active participation in a research community by newcomers and outsiders, and maintain low barriers to this participation.” Internships, co-op student placements, apprenticeships and sport development leagues all embody the same principle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These ambitions chime so squarely with my practice based PhD <a href="https://nodenogg.in/#/">nodenogg.in</a>, it made me very Happy.</p>

			 <p>This week I was able to attend day one of the latest European Women in Games Conference. What an awesome day. I’ve been fortunate enough to attend and participate in a number of Women in Games events but I have to say the conference this year was of the highest quality. The selection of speakers and panel guests were fantastic. Do look <a href="https://womeningamesconference.co.uk/">them all up</a> and catch some of the recorded talks on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wigj/profile">twitch</a> if you can.</p>
<p>It also solidified in my mind a rising issue that I have not really been able to stop thinking about since EGX Rezzed in <a href="https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html">April</a>. This relates to the mismatching between funding and funds. But also what needs to be funded.</p>
<p>I am confident individuals on the panels could have helped and so I want to try and connect to a number of them again. However I didn&rsquo;t pose questions at the event as who needs to hear from another privileged white male in that setting. More voices needed to express themselves at the event and I enjoyed every question and comment.</p>
<p>I do however want to move this concern of mine forward over the next year and will need help and support to do so.</p>
<p>So what am I talking about I hear you cry!?</p>
<p>The issue is why are &ldquo;the Games industry&rdquo; and the UK government not properly funding independent gaming making?</p>
<p>The data is clear: games and interactive experiences are able to create positive impact and behavioural change in ways that outstrip other media and outreach activities.</p>
<p>Games are proven to be more powerful than film and music in engaging people in empathy, understanding and compassion.</p>
<p>Games enable marginalised communities to tell their story in ways that bridge the gaps between people and communities.</p>
<p>This is coupled with the fact that our world faces challenges it has never seen before that truly require people to be united in order to make progress.</p>
<p>Yet every one of the makers that have realised that they can have this type of impact, raised concerns on funding, not just for the project itself but just to pay the bills. They often resign themselves to the fact that this is the life of an “Artist”. This is often coupled with a realisation that the large games companies fail to take risks and just back the same titles again and again.</p>
<p>The games industry is the biggest entertainment industry on the planet. The money in the games industry is huge.</p>
<p>The Planet needs people to make big changes in the way they engage with the environment and each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s appears we have found a medium that can right now be a huge force for positive change. We have games companies making massive  profits. Yet the creators that could lead the way in this are struggling to pay their household bills.</p>
<p>This is at least a missed opportunity and at worst a gross injustice given the clear need right now for global change.</p>
<p>Games can change the world so why are we not funding the heck out of independent game makers?</p>
<p>I thus think we need to raise awareness of the need for funding and lobby governments and companies to urgently fund diverse game making.</p>
<p>I have some ideas on where we could  start but need to do some more thinking about this and more importantly do this thinking with others.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think and if you would like to get involved via this forum link. <a href="https://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk/t/game-makers-unite/314">discourse.adamprocter.co.uk</a></p>
<p>My own initial quick ideas :</p>
<ul>
<li>Game makers need to know about all the funding that they could access across the creative industries.</li>
<li>Game makers need to have the up to date research and data on how games are and can have huge impact to support gaining funding.</li>
<li>Game makers need a place network to discuss and share resources to support indie game making.</li>
<li>Supporting a Sustainable diverse game maker community is really important.</li>
<li>Return on Investment is not the only  and possibly not the best way to measure success.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>So I decided the way to proceed was to create a folder on my VPS and run Site.js there and then work out how to use my gitlab to automate released from a locally ran Site.js so instead of using the Sync option I would control this via Gitlab, also a good excuse to learn some of the Continuous integration (CI) stuff using a simple project.</p>
<p>Logged into my VPS and created a folder. Ran wget no problem next to launch site&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Oh seriously, I&rsquo;m running CentOS 6.10. Went into Plesk and run all the updates on the server first to see if that helps. May well break everything else on my server&hellip; That didn&rsquo;t address the issue, but nothing else appears broken. Turns out I had tried to update GLIBC in the past according to the purple links in DuckDuckGo, so this is not looking promising. If I recall last time I had to undo the update as it broke stuff. The CentOS forum advises that it is impossible to update GLIBC beyond 2.12. Hmm I think my time with Site.js may have come to an annoying end. Might read some stuff on CI anyway. This is probably also another reason to look at Docker or such for my server as well, or request a new Cent OS 7 server and copy everything over to the new box, however that is a lot for just trying Site.js that I am yet to really need. It does however show that the Small Technology team would really benefit from one click install with hosting providors and a clear steer on how to connect and sync your local Site.js install although the issue with macOS and not being able to use rsync could be a real pain.</p>

			 <p>I realised that the interactive demo was more useful than I realised, I think on the site sitejs.org the first block of text should mirror the interactive demo, for people like me I kinda skipped it, or make the interactive demo more obvious and prominent. With the text clearly indicating the advanced features.</p>
<p>So now to sync thing up, I watched the demo a few more times and think I might have an idea, at first I was worried that I needed to run Site.js on my server but I don&rsquo;t think I do if that&rsquo;s just the remote end point. So now to work out my remote SSH log in as I normally land in via root or use SFTP.</p>
<p>Off to Plesk and searching to see if I can create a new SSH user straight into my new domain I couldn&rsquo;t see that as an option, a stack overflow advised to get into the right place do the following;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This worked for me to get to the right place but I am not sure if the &ndash;sync-to method would take that and what about the user.</p>
<p>Ok so tried</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I got a helpful error which said Error 127: Rsync not found; please run site enable &ndash;sync</p>
<p>Ok trying to enable sync next.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Blast. Thats a show stopper.</p>
<p>So I decided to take a look at the html file, maybe I should just copy that over but it was very very barebones, aka no structure just the one line I added.</p>
<p>Hmm so my conclusion at this point.</p>
<p>The advantages of Site.js will (I think) only come into play if I am running Site.js both locally and then copying or syncing to the remote which is also running Site.js otherwise I am just copying a plain html file to be server up via in my case Plesk/Apache. This will need more investigation as I will need to install and run Site.js on my VPS and then I suspect redirect requests for my new domain to said place using nginx, I do this for a couple of other services but I need to refresh my brain 🧠 on how to do this.

			 <p>Part one can be read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So I decided one last attempt with not installing homebrew (this was probably an ill conceived choice to be fair) I downloaded from developer.apple.com the Xcode command line tools and installed them. It seems from what I can tell that although they are now embedded in the Xcode IDE this would make them system wide. I installed 10.14 for Xcode 10.3. So set ./configure off and running again. Same error. Decided to quit Terminal and restart macOS just in case. Same issue. In case you forgot here is the screen shot.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ok visiting the main homebrew site <a href="https://brew.sh/">brew.sh</a> pasted this into terminal as per website</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Installation success and the first example they give is to install wget.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ok seemed to work now back to sitejs.org, ok wget now working and pulling down site.js, but it asks for a password, which I assume is my mac password, Site.js reports done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yes it turns on, why didn&rsquo;t I just use homebrew to start, I think perhaps Sitejs could suggest that for macOS deployment.</p>
<p>visiting <a href="https://localhost">localhost</a> I get this though.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But this is a good sign as its running, my guess is that I have no pages. I wonder if this could be a nicer error in that instance ? Hmm not sure why perhaps I can message Aral and see if he thinks this is possible and worth it. Hmmm the interactive demo suggests I should see the words Hello Development ? I am not sure where any of the files are located on my mac at this time. I recall CTRL C will terminate the running action in terminal. I make a new folder in Finder and move to that in terminal and run site again. Nothing appears in the folder, this suggests to me the step to add a default hello development text in a index.html was not created hence the 404, so I try as per the interactive demo (some of the steps are missing in the text version below) the following</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and run site again &hellip; YES ! now its working and that folder has a file in it called index.html excellent.</p>

			 <p>So I bought a domain (at hover.com) changed the name servers to mine ns1 and ns2 .adamprocter.co.uk I then created the domain on my VPS (virtual private server) run by Cloudabove, I use Plesk to do this and clicked to include Lets Encrypt. Removed all the default files and added a very basic index.html for now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So now step one I thought was to get Site.js running on my local machine and then try and sync it to my remote host. I visited <a href="https://sitejs.org">sitejs.org</a> , I clicked the suggested always view the source code link, that hit a 404, hmmm I&rsquo;ll carry on anyway. Even though I couldn&rsquo;t review the code as the site encouraged me too, but it is day one so maybe its probably a minor over sight. Messaged Aral to let him know.</p>
<p>My intial concern was that it was running at <a href="https://localhost">localhost</a> without an option I could see to pick a port, which made me assume it would be port 80 but I couldn&rsquo;t tell, would this break other things, I didn&rsquo;t want to break any of my other webbed stuff, such as the vue ui stuff I have been working on. Site.js seemed to suggest uninstall would be easy so I thought I would go ahead anyway. (that maybe a mistake&hellip;)</p>
<p>Ok so first to run the wget command as Site.js advises.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hmm that wasn&rsquo;t what I expected. So I started to search (on Duckduckgo of course) macOS wget, first site suggests I need to install homebrew, I have been down this route before and wasn&rsquo;t too keen to install home-brew and one site suggesting this then followed with the line;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I kept looking and another site I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->found<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looked promising as was published in 2019 and explained you can install wget via Xcode, that seems like a fine way for me as I have Xcode. The site did however suggest installing Xcode command line tools via terminal but as far as I was aware the command line tools are now bundled with Xcode (since 10.9) so I skipped that step.</p>
<p>When I extracted the file I suddenly thought this may not be the latest wget so I user my Browser (Firefox) to visit <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/">ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/</a> and realised that wget-1.19.5 was indeed an old version. Ok so I deleted the files that had been downloaded and extracted. And this time I used this line instead, which should get me the latest version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and then I used cd into that folder which was wget-1.20.3 and run ./configure  &hellip; seemed to be going well &hellip; and then not</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The site advised if you get a config error try ./configure &ndash;with-ssl=openssl</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I had been at this for over an hour now and it was getting late. I decided to stop for now. Part 2 can be read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The ongoing nightmare for both Bolton and Bury in League 1 ⚽️ hurts everyone, delayed fixtures, uncertain futures and fans in turmoil. Both clubs should have never been allowed to get into this much trouble, the EFL needs to think about its role in this as much as they seem to currently be allowing time to hear positive news. Reminds me of why I love AFC Wimbledon so much, fan owned, run within budget and the league status is not as important as a community club. I hope Bolton and Bury find a way out and I would say to their fans don’t underestimate what a Fans Trust is capable of, just look at what we have managed. It’s not all about how much money 💰 you have (or borrow or gamble on having!). I am concerned that the crunching of fixtures will be unfair on teams like us whose season long fitness can be much harder to maintain due to smaller squad sizes, I will be looking very sternly in the direction of the EFL if this is becomes an issue. They will need to think very seriously about how they arrange the missing fixtures and not stick to timelines for the sake of timelines.</p>

			 <p>Triggered Siri on my watch today by scratching my head, I am pleased that no one in Ireland will listen to that recording without my knowledge but I am disappointed people are losing their jobs. We all want a better Siri and I cannot for the life of me think why Apple didn’t come up with a consent first option and allowed a legit way for us to share our odd Siri mistakes to make Siri better. Apple should be rushing to address this not just fire people (I understand they don’t work directly for Apple). Like many (iOS geeks) I love to keep screenshots of Siri&rsquo;s wonderful mistakes and would have been happy to send various recordings of them … all Apple had to do was just ask me.</p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;ve scratched out my first round of design principles for nodenoggin. Next up make some posters for the principles. Would welcome feedback or comment at <a href="https://discourse.adamprocter.co.uk">discourse.adamprocter.co.uk</a> 🦉 or via micro.blog mentions 👍</p>
<h2 id="delight">Delight.</h2>
<p>Support delightful design, the people feel good and empowered. Must be intuitive to empower the user. (test, test, test)</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-connecting">Knowledge connecting.</h2>
<p>Build knowledge together making connections you would not find without others.</p>
<h2 id="serendipity">Serendipity.</h2>
<p>Enable the collective to wander and get lost in the journey to find solutions or ideas that would at first seem totally unconnected.</p>
<h2 id="augment">Augment.</h2>
<p>Must extend the physical act of being in a space solving design problems and seeking knowledge and ideas with others.</p>
<h2 id="collaborative">Collaborative.</h2>
<p>Enhance and support the collective. The collective is always better than the individual.</p>
<h2 id="reflective">Reflective.</h2>
<p>The tool allows for reflective practice and review outside of working with others.</p>
<hr>
<p>These next principles are overarching and need a little more work I believe but I also want to keep them as simple as possible.</p>
<h2 id="free-software">Free software.</h2>
<p>All the source must be free software as in free speech and open for anyone to see, use and change.</p>
<h2 id="open-web">Open web.</h2>
<p>The web is important and should not be driven by data theft and adverts.</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy.</h2>
<p>Respect the person and their data at all times. Their data is first on their devices. Sync does not take away ownership and does not store data that cannot be controlled by the person whose data it is.</p>
<h2 id="ethical">Ethical.</h2>
<p>The data belongs to the people, never hold the keys to other peoples data. They choose how to share, delete and must be able to export.</p>
<h2 id="inclusive">Inclusive</h2>
<p>Design for everyone.</p>

Here is one image of us at the top of the oldest operational light house in the world at Hook Head, Ireland. Wikipedia and Google claim the Spanish Tower of Hercules is the oldest however this was rebuilt/ refurbished much later on and although technically older than the one in Hook Head, Hook Head is the exact same medieval building unchanged and so the tour guides and locals claim the number one spot. 💡</p>

			 <p>I’ve now seen this to many times for it not to be dark design. In iOS when going from a link in YouTube or the Hangouts app the first time you attempt to follow link you are presented with 2 options (image 1) however link two doesn’t open Safari as it suggests but takes you to the App Store to install The Google App (if you don’t have it installed). If you quit this action and dismiss the sheet and click the link again you will this time be presented with the correct 3 options (image 2) of which the third option is now open in Safari and works as expected.</p>
<p>Can anyone else confirm this on there devices? Open a google owned app and try to follow a link and see what options are presented.</p>

<p>They present and take the simplified easy route and blame something others can quickly latch onto but game makers cannot just stand by and not show they consider the products they put into the world and rely on the research that shows no direct link to real world violence. Games can be such powerful tools for good so let’s ensure as designers we think about our choices and not refrain from the difficult conversations. If we design a violent world we should be able to debate our choices and reasoning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a familiar refrain from the developers of violent games – that they’re creating escapist entertainment. But this isn’t really good enough. If your game uses real-world weapons, real-world locations and real-world conflicts you can’t simply recuse yourself from moral and political debate.</p>

			 <p>I originally met Dai Barnes via <a href="https://micro.blog/thoughtshrapnel">@thoughtshrapnel</a> (Doug Belshaw) and I only had the chance to meet him once in person. It was in a nice pub on a hot day in London for Amy’s Burvalls book launch. The event was wonderful and Dai was so nice, friendly and funny, a great storyteller, I love these types of people so I stayed for as long as I could. I often think about how he managed to navigate London barefoot🦶that day and was one of those people that I hoped to figure out a way to meet again in person. I don’t believe I have any photos of that encounter. Dai was just as engaging and friendly on Slack, Twitter and the podcast TIDE he did with Doug. Doug informed me that Friday (Aug 2nd) he passed away in his sleep. Still shocked. My thoughts are with Doug and our connected friends and Dai’s family. Stay Strong friends.</p>

			 <p>This is a really nice interview with Indieweb Co-founders <a href="https://micro.blog/t">@t</a> &amp; <a href="https://micro.blog/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a> talking to <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> at the last indieweb conf 2018 on <a href="http://dctr.pro/2e2">manton.org</a> Bit of history, context and thoughtful commentary.</p>
<p>Oddly enough the discussion about phone numbers was interesting to me as I have in fact had the same number since I first got a mobile (cell) phone around 1998/99 and had this goal to never change it, it use to frustrate me when I would get a text from people saying here’s my new number&hellip; I just like the fact that anyone from my past could still call me up (if they really wanted to 😂). The connection of this was to the fact that domain registering can be a little fiddly which I agreed more with @manton that this is stil a little to odd so if @manton can add a super easy domain set up path as part of <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> registration or one click upgrade that would be rather awesome specially for new comers to just get a blog, I guess a little like WordPress but with the bonus of the MB timeline (if you want it). For me the ongoing battle is always with this stuff is working towards opaque frictionless technology coupled with delightful design. I still find a number on Indieweb things too complicated and supposedly I know what I am doing&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I do like the opening 2 paragraphs for all day teaching platform event I am attending today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether it be through collaboration, in a collective or as part of a cohort, the practices of making are never without context and commonly not undertaken alone.  We understand that our students are keen to make and work in disciplinary and interdisciplinary networks as this nourishes and supports creative practice, reflecting the fluidity of the professional environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Networked making, including writing, is often facilitated by digital connections which allow us to go beyond the physical boundaries of the studio, seminar room or lecture theatre. Yet, while we all ‘work online’ in some form, the practices of networked making are still emerging. The diversity of voices the digital allows us to include and connect encourages us to reconsider our modes of learning and teaching for making.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Firstly and correctly mental health is a big issue and something I care deeply about, having seen mental health issues rising in Universities year on year, having friends that suffer with mental health issues and occasionally doubting my own mental health with work and family pressures, not to mention when that imposter syndrome kicks in, we have to get better at supporting and helping to tackle mental health. As one of the two undergraduate Senior Personal Academic tutors at Winchester School of Art I am also exposed to a lot more of these issues, so I know we need action. However the surveillance of students is not the way to solve this issue. As many reading this blog you will know one of my long term concerns has been the potential infectious nature that Silicon Valleys Big data model could have on education. So I am opposed to the project just announced by Northumbria University.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A £2m project supported by the OfS will use innovative integration of technology, advanced educational data analytics, student relationship management and student support to provide an understanding of the opportunities to predict whether a student is already experiencing or will have a mental health crisis. (<a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/northumbria-university-to-lead-transformation-in-how-the-higher-education-sector/">2019</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project is backed by the OfS, the OfS are an independent public body they are not part of central Government, but they have to report to Parliament through the Department for Education (DfE).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want every student to have a fulfilling experience of higher education that enriches their lives and careers. (<a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/about/our-strategy/">2019</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a nice diagram of how they plan to achieve this goal. Concerning for me is the foundation stone appears to be &ldquo;value for money&rdquo;. I do not see much detail on how the OfS define value for money but in much of the press there has been too much emphasis on return on investment and the pure utilitarian view of higher education.  Measuring your degree against your future incoming is a very simplistic and poor metric.</p>
<p>In this mental health technology project the main technology partner is Civitas Learning International. They do seem to sell products but you have to question their business model, following round after round of Venture Capital funding I cannot but suspect these backers will want to ensure the technology pays them back.  Civitas are a for profit company after all.</p>
<p>Here is a quick list of their Funding announcements over the last few years;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/28/civitas-learning-gets-60-million-commitment-from-warburg-pincus/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_cs=XQI4EfKi6SIl5jJYVdtDdg">$60 Million </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.civitaslearning.com/press/civitas-learning-closes-16-million-in-funding-to-continue-trailblazing-efforts-in-data-science-and-student-success/">$16 Million</a></li>
<li><a href="http://newmarketsvp.com/2013/06/20/civitas-learning-closes-8-75-million-in-funding-to-achieve-big-goals-with-big-data-in-higher-education/">$8million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/civitas-learning#section-investors">Crunchbase details</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the middle of this funding they &lsquo;had to&rsquo; lay off 10% of staff as well, note the reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>last week that the layoffs were part of a “strategic shift” that “forced Civitas to let go of some talent and post new jobs for positions better suited for the company’s future” in personalized pathways and predictive analytics offerings.(2017)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predictive analytics. Zuboff shows us clearly in The Age of Surveillance (2019) that prediction is the key piece to manipulate and modify human behaviour for capitalist gains.</p>
<p>Civitas again laid off more staff at the start of this year (2019) and again this was shortly after more funding (<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-02-27-another-investment-another-round-of-layoffs-for-civitas-learning">EdSurge</a>) Plus there is certainly a lot of negative reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Civitas-Learning-RVW18170194.htm">Glassdoor</a>.</p>
<p>I do not see any good actors in this project at this stage.</p>
<p>Could this £2million have been spent differently to support mental health within Universities I have a strong sense it could have been.  I&rsquo;ll watch this project with concerned Interest.</p>

I imagine a room which is totally flexible in terms of layout, cameras for VR wall mounted and has numerous screens around d the space. These screens have fly out leads but are also connected via super speedy Ethernet to rack mounted power houses Windows/ Linux or now a Mac box.</p>

			 <p>I got a cool badge yesterday as I’m now an official Gitkraken Amassador! Basically GitKraken is an awesome way to use git version control. I use it with my own projects and workshop it with students to use within there games teams. It is visually awesome and the well designed UI makes a lot of the git complexity very easy to use. If you want to check it out please use this referral link as then we both might win a Nintendo Switch! <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/uwPBRPCR">www.gitkraken.com/invite/uw&hellip;</a></p>

<h2 id="part-3-unlocking-the-huge-potential-of-indie-by-challenging-the-attitudes-of-the-industry">Part 3: Unlocking the huge potential of indie by challenging the attitudes of the industry.</h2>
<p>I fundamentally believe we need games that speak to and from a diverse audience and this means taking risks and making projects that do not consider the bottom line or return on investment as the primary motivator. Indie game making is not, as the Rezzed panel seemed to suggest, just to provide a route into the industry.</p>
<p>Games are huge. Games are the biggest entertainment medium on the planet. This provides a massive audience with diverse tastes. And this is a massive audience that can be spoken to. We see the systematic destruction of the planet, the rise in fear of ‘the other’ and communities breaking down. There is a power to be had in games as art, and games as social commentary, an opportunity to hold a mirror up to the world and see things differently.</p>
<p>Due to the popularity of Games they are in a unique position to do more than just entertain the 40 million plus players. Might this position be harnessed and become a force for good, a place for anyone to tell their story? Further, the creative thinking and the creative nature of games could be one of the puzzle pieces used to help solve some of the planet’s biggest problems to date: global warming and political unrest to name but two.</p>
<p>So, my call to action is that UKIE and the industry should do much more to encourage the truly creative side of games in the UK. The ‘indie’ panel discussion focus on skills, money, business planning and ‘what the ‘industry’ wants’ does little to encourage or ensure that there continues to be a diverse community of makers, lead not just by white men, money, and publishers that have “made it”.</p>
<p>We should note as well that the industry at one end has unstable employment, developer burn out and more games being made by contracting ‘teams’. While those making ‘indie’ games need to have a day job to support themselves and ensure they have the business acumen to go cap in hand to the publishers, who are not disposed to take risks. Where is the investment in new companies and creative start-ups?</p>
<p>There was some brief discussion on trickle down payment streaming services: making games that are twitchable or supporting games via services such as the Venture Capital (VC) backed Patreon. Although none of these options where discussed in much depth and the discussion was connected to looking at other industries that have seen change via digital disruption, specifically pointing to the music industry. The picture painted was that Games would move towards a market of the Beyoncé’s and the artists living off Bandcamp or subsidiary sales such as merchandise to sustain making ‘indie’ games. What a dividing and terrible situation. The Music industry is not in a good place. This is not a sustainable future I would want for games. So why not think differently? Why doesn&rsquo;t UKIE lobby companies and governments to invest in these creative endeavours? The panel touched on mid-size companies folding or closing down and connected this to bad business, but I suspect this is a very simplistic view of the situation and again likely more related to demands for return on investment and VC exits.</p>
<p>Itch.io continues to be very interesting. Why not invest in a space for UK makers within itch.io? Perhaps UKIE already do? Why not look at the model of investment in the Arts in Canada? The UK games tax break is good, but the ability for only match funding schemes in the UK is very poor. A later panel on running a games studio asked for game makers to show products that shipped in their portfolios if they wanted to get selected to work on the contracted team within bigger products. How about supporting individuals to do this? That could be a very productive approach to ‘routes into the industry’.</p>
<p>Apple Arcade, for which I have positive thoughts, was also rolled out as one of the new Netflix style models for games. Yet all the companies showcased so far are well established and I do not yet see details of how Apple Arcade would support new initiatives. Will they still be left hidden in the ‘free to play’ wasteland? Have Apple hired a bunch of new individuals to even source and select great games? Should UKIE look for ways to support creatives to get onto this platform directly?</p>
<p>Sony have been incubating game teams and projects for decades and really understand games. Yet we don&rsquo;t see Sony backing the types of risks much in recent years. E3 for example in the last 2-3 years in terms of showcasing small projects in the keynote has been particularly poor. A quick comparison of Sony over recent years shows a marked difference. Journey was delayed, over budget and yet Sony took the risk and kept faith in the team, adjusted schedules and injected money. No Man’s Sky, which is now winning awards and much delayed praise, was released - it appears - under pressure from Sony and in doing so damaged the team and the game. Yet it seems many of the things Sean Murray, owner of Hello Games, mentioned and was accused of tricking players into purchasing or over promising, now appear in the game after 2 more years of development. Hello Games have also announced a Hello Games Short.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Hello Games Short. Like Pixar shorts it’s a way to foster creativity and new voices in the studio. We started by making Joe Danger, before No Man’s Sky, and we want to pay forward our success to give others the opportunity to do the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more voices being fostered across the ‘industry’. Voices that understand the power of games as a medium for compassion, storytelling, empathy, understanding and as an art form. Then perhaps we can still wrestle back some of the potential of games without having to allow the marketeers and money makers to lead the way to Rockstars (no pun intended) and poor artists. The games industry could be better than this.</p>
<p>Indie games are not dead. I see Indie games as being a vital part of the games industry, the gamer community and society in general. Other funding models are out there, for example co-operative, open (source) business, ethical funding. They do exist and do work. Let&rsquo;s see the ‘industry’ invest across the piece for both positive change and diversity as well as the next blockbuster hits. I call for Indie game makers to unite and ask the ‘industry’ to do more to support the wider field of game making.</p>
<h2 id="summary-and-conclusion">Summary and conclusion</h2>
<p>I really feel the expert panel missed the opportunities to celebrate what UK indie was, is and will be. Their focus on the business aspects was poor and the advice didn’t come over as well informed to support indie making in the way that it could. I would like to see the UK industry and UK organisations support the potential for indie game making as expanding and advancing games as an art form and games as social commentary, alongside the more quirky and innovative side of games as entertainment and escapism. A missed opportunity to really open the lid on the broad reach of diverse game making. There was no indication that the focus on money, return on investment and some rather poor suggestions for choices of new business models could in fact really impact creativity within the field and something we should be aware of. Investment, nurture and risk taking is what has gotten the industry where it is now, let’s not lose that to the drum of neoliberal capitalism.</p>

			 <p>This is part 2 of a 3 part blog, part 1 “Misunderstandings of the history of indie development and how the Rezzed panel sold short the significance of indie” can be read <a href="https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/03/indie-games-are.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-why-indie-is-still-important-developers-motivations-and-the-value-of-games-education">Part 2: Why indie is still important, developer’s motivations and the value of games education.</h2>
<p>The Rezzed panel discussion highlighted to me a worrying parallel with the changes in the emergent UK indie scene and our present moment in the industry. The few games the panel held up as indie included The Cultist Simulator which cost £140k+ to produce and Monument Valley which had nearly £2million in initial investment. In a year in which UKIE released stats showing a record spend on games in the UK where is this money going? Where could a new game maker or makers get access to this type investment, if this is what’s needed to make any game for market? Thus, the discussion ended up revolving mainly around how even indie game makers must become business savvy.</p>
<p>The panel mentioned Unity 3d (2005) and Unity’s position and claim to have helped democratise game making - which I agree with. When Unity came out it was a moment when I also thought ‘Wow - this will be how creatives and artists could start to speak via games’, and they did. However, I have to note that at the time, most of the ‘industry’ laughed at the release during Apples WWDC in 2005. “You can&rsquo;t make games on macOS” was the cry. And only a few years ago another educator tried to belittle me and our choice to use Unity as our main engine, when in general conversation they advised me “you know that’s not industry standard”. The thoughts of what education is for also echoed in my mind at this point and it’s certainly not to teach Unity or Unreal.</p>
<p>The Graveyard (Belgium, 2009) is a fantastic example of what Unity could and would go on to do. Yet how can the so-called budget requirements mentioned support ongoing democratisation?</p>
<p>In 2008 the UK based Media Molecule released Little Big Planet and Sony talked about Game 3.0. Games that would allow players to be creators; consumers could become creators. We are now closer than ever to realising Game 3.0. In fact, a decade later, a recent Edge (March 2018) article nodded towards this and got me excited again. But this can only happen if we encourage creatives to use these tools and not be concerned with the commercial potential of their ideas. It is clear that Media Molecules Dreams is this type of Game 3.0 tool.</p>
<p>I have since spoken to some of the Media Molecule team and asked directly about paid content creation, which although currently is not an option, it is something they have thought about and very much see the value of paying creators. So we as artists and designers need to push developers such as Media Molecule, to not take advantage of free content producers. Those companies that start to pioneer in this emerging Game 3.0 field will no doubt draw more talent to the industry, with possibly interesting and sustainable business models for content creators. I will touch on the concepts of monetisation the panel nodded towards in my third post, but you may have guessed I didn’t agree with the panel’s thoughts on parallels towards following the music industry.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the panel discussion, one piece of advice was to not waste money on a Games Development course at University, and the suggestion that you can learn Games Development via a Google search. The panel were heard to laugh in agreement at this statement. Now I am a huge advocate of open education resources and I once learnt how to fix a problem with part of my car on YouTube; however, that doesn&rsquo;t make me a mechanic and I wouldn&rsquo;t advocate all mechanics should learn their trade on YouTube. Throw-away comments such as these, and other concerning trends, see people like Peter Thiel offering $100k “to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom”. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of education.</p>
<p>I believe each panel member had a degree, albeit not in games, so I must assume they do in fact value the usefulness of higher education. In view of this, perhaps the wording of the statement should have been more carefully selected, or otherwise qualified, rather than being diminishing and dismissive. The benefit of working cooperatively with educators is much more useful than bashing them. Universities offer much more than skills.</p>
<p>If we agree that the way to solve some of the most complex problems is through creative thinking, then I am confident Universities offer this space through a variety of subjects. And I happen to think Games is a very strong area in which to apply this type of thinking.</p>
<p>Young people need to build confidence, collaborative skills, design thinking and creative investigation in order to create exciting and innovative games, be that for entertainment or social good. They also need structure and deadlines, and you can&rsquo;t learn that from YouTube. I am learning the Godot Game Engine via Youtube and some paid Kickstarter content however my process of thinking was transformed by Art School and I know this still positively affects me today. I don&rsquo;t think I can put it better than Douglas Rushkoff did in a recent <a href="http://dctr.pro/2d0">article</a> so I am just going to quote from him here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>School (University) is a means of promoting not social control, or even productivity, but the higher value of learning itself. School (University) is less valuable for the information or skills transmitted than the mimesis — the live mirroring and modelling — through which students learn to think critically, develop rapport, and establish solidarity. School (University) is not directed at our utilitarian value, but our essential, intrinsic dignity. How profoundly sad it is that many of us think of a Harvard education more as a professional credential than a pinnacle of humanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/IK5QDAhmAdQ">talk</a> I attended later, from the designer of Knights and Bikes, was excellent and his Art School Education was clearly evident in the level of detail in the game and the way the game is likely to speak to players. His final slide of a death metal poster where one band clearly stood out was a call for game makers to be that band. To be different and to say something through games. The ‘indie’ panel discussion instead seemed focussed on playing it safe and balancing the cheque book. I believe strongly that this is likely to lead to uncreative and unimaginative games.</p>
<p>I fundamentally believe we need games that speak to and from a diverse audience and this means taking risks and making projects that do not consider the bottom line or return on investment as the primary motivator. Indie game making is not, as the panel seemed to suggest, just to provide a route into the industry.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/14/part-unlocking-the.html">final part</a> I will discuss the real potential of indie games.</p>

			 <p>At the recent Rezzed games event in London, I attended an expert panel discussion on indie games. This blog was prompted by my strong reactions to, and critique of, the panel’s observations. It is in three parts.</p>
<p>Part 1: Misunderstandings of the history of indie development and how the Rezzed panel sold short the significance of indie games. <em>(this post)</em></p>
<p>Part 2: Why indie development is still important, developer’s motivations and the value of games education. <a href="https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/08/indie-games-are.html">Read here</a></p>
<p>Part 3: Unlocking the huge potential of indie by challenging the attitudes of the industry.  <a href="https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/14/part-unlocking-the.html">Read here</a></p>
<p>As background, I should declare my interest.  I teach a progressive BA in Games Design &amp; Art within an Art School, Winchester School of Art, which is part of the University of Southampton a research-led Russell Group University. I see the power of games to tell hidden stories, evoke emotions and build bridges for social good and as a strong future part of diverse game making. This might be through ‘serious games’ but more likely it will be through great game play and games that entertain as well as provide moments of thought and ponder. Games are an art form that can comment on society and fulfil the function of art. So, I hold games in a very high regard. I see the possibilities of these types of games coming from the ‘indie’ artists, makers and designers. In this 3-part blog, I will unpick these ideas further. Oh, and by way of a disclaimer, I have never worked in the games ‘industry’.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-misunderstandings-of-the-history-of-indie-development-and-how-the-rezzed-panel-sold-short-the-significance-of-indie">Part 1: Misunderstandings of the history of indie development and how the Rezzed panel sold short the significance of indie.</h2>
<p>Prior to attending Rezzed I pointed out to my final year students that the Leftfield Collection space was the area to focus on. Although there would be other rooms devoted to ‘indie’, the Leftfield Collection would give them opportunities to speak directly to makers, not community managers or publishers.
As a fan of ‘indie’ games, I was also pretty excited about the expo’s ‘30 years of indie’ talk, coinciding with the thirtieth anniversary of UKIE (The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment). Rather than a conventional talk, it came in the format of a panel discussion that was recorded as a podcast (and can be heard <a href="https://30yearsofplay.uk/podcast/30yearsofindie">here</a>).</p>
<p>As the panel discussion drew to a close the question, I was formulating was something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the start of this talk you alluded to the UK indie scene starting more than 30 years ago in the games of Matthew Smith and Jeff Minter. It is a fact that this type of game making and creativity was gone or pushed to the fringes when money, the marketeers and publishers took over. UKIE have just reported the biggest spend on video games in the UK and yet the titles you mentioned now as ‘indie’: Cultist, £140k to make; Monument Valley somewhere in the region of £2m to make. And thus, you laughingly suggest indie is dead. Instead, shouldn’t the ‘industry’ and UKIE look for ways to better support emerging talent and truly diversify game making?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it’s a good thing that I didn’t get picked to ask my question as I’m not sure that, at the time, it would have fully conveyed my thoughts. Hopefully, with this 3 part blog, I can unpack more of my thoughts and try to consider alternative solutions to those the panel partially painted for emergent ‘indie’ game makers.</p>
<p>You will have gathered that I was pretty frustrated at the direction the panel took the discussion, but it solidified in my mind clear issues that could see the real growing demand for a diversity of games and game makers crushed by ‘the industry’.</p>
<p>Actually, I should probably start with a point from the panel which I agreed with. The term ‘indie’ is now problematic and not so relevant today within games. And yes, the term indie was likely connected to certain types of game making from around 2004 and was clearly appropriated from the music industry and the indie music scene which had seen a huge growth in the late nineties and early two thousands. ‘Indie’ games have been typically seen as falling into these concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>no publisher</li>
<li>independent</li>
<li>personal</li>
<li>experimental</li>
<li>creative</li>
<li>low budget</li>
<li>niche</li>
<li>cool</li>
<li>intellectual</li>
<li>pretentious</li>
<li>artistic</li>
<li>weird</li>
<li>cheap</li>
<li>no profit</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I believe the panel missed a key concern by not seeing a direct connection with the current situation and one that decimated the emergent UK ‘indie’ scene in the late 80s. The older games mentioned - Manic Miner (UK, 1983) and Hover Bovver (UK, 1983) - were followed by a limited number of later ‘indie’ game references, such as Fez (Canada, 2012) and Florence (Australia, 2018). Evidently, there was a decades-long time gap between the games the panel touched upon - something that seemed to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>It seemed that the vast majority of the discussion actually focused on the need to be business-savvy and to understand the commercial aspects of making games. The focus on return on investment was disheartening. While I’m confident that the lead designer of Florence, Ken Wong, is very business-savvy, his comments made after winning a BAFTA reveal his motives:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazing things can happen, my greatest hope by Florence winning awards, getting press, a getting good reception, I hope it encourages creators to strive for the same goals and tell their own stories (BAFTA , BBC Radio 5 interview)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an MVC interview the Florence team also showed how they regularly discussed how film and books often explored love and human emotions, but that this was less explored within games and was something they wanted to tackle. The game wasn’t led by business motivations, but motivations to tell new stories.</p>
<p>With this in mind lets take a brief look at what the panel host stated as the start of the ‘indie’ games scene in the UK, the work of Mathew Smith and Jeff Minter. This start had a direct connection to the home computer scene: the home computer was between £125-£175 and Sir Clive Sinclair inventor of the Spectrum saw the power in getting computers into people&rsquo;s homes. This was the start of democratisation of computing in the UK. The ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64 lead the way in encouraging creative game making.</p>
<p>Manic Miner was one such game although the panel mistakenly connected its influence as a statement on the mining crisis and battle during the political reign of Margret Thatcher, something that still has ripple effects today. It was in fact Peter Harapp’s game Wanted: Monty Mole that took direct influence. However, the landscape Matthew Smith grew up in was one directly affected by the Miner strikes and creative work is always influenced by the climate it emerges from. Hover Bovver was a light hearted game, in what has become the traditional oddball humour of Jeff Minter. A simple maze game in which you have stolen a mower from your neighbour to cut your own grass with the opening theme a rendition of Greensleeves blasting out in pure chiptune style. This experimental bubble continued for a few years with many bedroom artists speaking through games. That is, until the money arrived and return on investment became a key concern. This decimated a large part of the creative side of the industry for years to come.</p>
<p>The discussion, I hoped, would have been a broader view of the background to, and history of, indie games in the UK. In my work, I give talks on various game and design histories to my students each year, one of which ends with the title of this blog and is about a history of ‘indie’ games. I attribute the history of indie and other areas as starting much earlier than many realise. Within video games I suggest it starts in the 1960s with the PDP1 and Spacewar! made by a handful of engineers at MIT. This type of innovation in the ‘indie’ space continues up until today. I thus feel I have a good level of understanding around the history of ‘indie’ games. I also grew up on the ZX Spectrum (with the rubber keys!), the Amstrad CPC and the Amiga 500 before going to Art School to study Animation. I am also a big fan of open education, Creative Commons, open source &amp; free software alongside indie and alternative music.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://discursive.adamprocter.co.uk/2019/05/08/indie-games-are.html">next part</a> of this blog, I will build on this understanding to argue that indie is still important, to argue that the value of games education was unfairly trivialised, and to consider developers motivations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>School is a means of promoting not social control, or even productivity, but the higher value of learning itself. School is less valuable for the information or skills transmitted than the mimesis — the live mirroring and modeling — through which students learn to think critically, develop rapport, and establish solidarity. School is not directed at our utilitarian value, but our essential, intrinsic dignity. How profoundly sad it is that many of us think of a Harvard education more as a professional credential than a pinnacle of humanism.</p>

<p>Trees can now have their own unique value and so the bigger the tree the more chops it takes but the more oxygen depleted when finally cut down. Each tree chopped updates the level oxygen levels accurately.</p>
<p>Next up Axe being blunting per chop and the sharpening machines. Once that’s in place I can try and figure out a level layout for testing. As that will be all the core mechanics in place. Although I’ve not tried to connect my retro usb joystick 🕹 up yet which is part of the experience.</p>
<p>BONUS: I could now have different axes with some being better at chopping but maybe due to weight slow player down (thats a extra option for complexity)</p>

			 <p>Maybe I’m a optimist but wow Apple’s + services seem to be setting out a series of platforms to try to build unity and empathy. (Humanity Centred Design as I like to call it)</p>
<p>So a question. Doesn’t Apple have enough money in the bank, and other income streams to provide this thought provoking Games and TV service without a need for subscription? Or am I just naive about the role of capitalism and Apple bottom line.</p>
<p>Or is this just the classic Walmart move to sell organic products as the market forced demand, coupled with my love of Apple (the cult), completely jading my own point of view?</p>
<p>I guess organisations such as Greenpeace ask for donations and sponsorship and thus it’s voice is (unfortunately) tiny (still).</p>
<p>Perhaps based on the fact Apple will not make much profit from said services. (according to a number of analysts) It is in fact a positive thing Apple already have enough money in the bank to be able to take a stance on global issues and are in the position that they do not need to build another “entertainment” platform such as Netflix or Prime (originals) and can provide people with these different types of originals.</p>
<p>I guess only time will tell if they have the impact on humanity they hope for.</p>

			 <p>Obviously I agree with the idea of creating games that the mainstream wouldn’t make and games that redefine games. That’s the kind of games programme I run, this new platform and pitch also makes a lot of sense from Apple.</p>
<p>We don’t know much about the platform for players and even less it seems for developers so here are my quick thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>The current 100 (we got a peak of at least) look excellent but they are well established developers and game makers already?</p>
<p>How will this platform support new game makers? Innovative games will come from new studios being created by new makers and those joining to make new studios think Astroneer.</p>
<p>What is the funding model for said companies from Apple ? They said they help developers ? How? If they want to foster new types of games a platform is not enough?</p>
<p>How will the subscription money be divided ? Across 100 + companies ? I guess they are banking on a lot of the 1 Billion iOS players moving to this model ?</p>
<p>Are they hiring more game experts to help pick the next games to be “exclusive” to Apple Arcade</p>
<p>Exclusive? seemed odd as a number of games shown where ports? For example the awesome Overland</p>
<p>Can games thus be “upgraded” to Apple Arcade?</p>
<p>Will this create another tiered game barrier?</p>
<p>Will this damage paid games in the “normal” game store? And thus encourage more ad driven and in app games in this space ?</p>
<p>Does the game have to work on all platforms from day one of release?</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll think of more as the time goes on and as we find out more. Not being a Google fan and wanting games that are different, games as an art form and games as cultural artifacts, this certainly appeals more than Stadia to me as a player and designer. Of course I expect I’ll subscribe on day one.</p>
<p>ASIDE: So can we now expect Apple to actually make a decent controller for Apple TV&hellip; but then again if Apple Arcade is all platforms that has a big limit on special capabilities so I guess a controller for all devices is coming. 👾</p>

			 <p>A recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-47333027">BBC article</a> about games addiction. With a comment from Therapist Matthew Preece who believes games are being designed to be addictive;</p>
<p>Here is some of my quotes from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/18/truth-gaming-addiction-world-health-organization-disorder-games">Guardian</a> as I don’t agree with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Procter says that game makers “should be aware that the product they’re making will have an impact on players”, and that “there will always be a responsibility for makers to consider their impact on the world”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“As designers, we should recognise this rise in games addiction, and have an open discussion about industry wide safeguards along with parent education,” he says.</p>

<p>Against the backdrop of news stories about how the web is misused, it’s understandable that many people feel afraid and unsure if the web is really a force for good. But given how much the web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30. If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web. (Berners-Lee, 2019)</p>

			 <p>It appears that Mr. Zuckerberg continues to be deluded. Strangely he continues to deny the unethical buisness model and mode of operation he has been part of creating and tries to rewrite his own companies history!? He explains 15 years of Facebook that seems to be at odds with the reality as we know it and then tries to place himself on the side of the open web&hellip; The Steve Jobs reality distortion field was good but this is on another level and perhaps only surrounds Mark himself!!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a tendency of some people to &hellip; overly emphasize the negative, and in some cases to go so far as saying the shift &hellip; is mostly harmful to society and democracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet&hellip;those “some people” seem to have a record of knowing what they are talking about through research and rigour</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is the dominance of one search engine, one big social network, one for microblogging. We don’t have a technology problem, we have a social problem. (Sir Tim Berners-Lee, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While Facebook may feel like a modern town square, the company determines, according to its own interests, what we see and learn. (Dr. Cathy O&rsquo;Neil, 2016)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behaviour. (Prof. Shoshana Zuboff, 2019)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So glad to be off to hear Professor Zuboff talk tomorrow (Tuesday) in London.</p>

			 <p>It was with great sadness that I was informed that <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsa/about/staff/ar4x07.page">Ashok Ranchhod</a> had passed away on January the 3rd 2019. I didn’t know Ashok outside of work but he was a kind, funny and interesting person. Ashok had been at the School of Art since 2011.</p>
<p>Ashok was really an unsung hero of the BA (Hons) Games Design &amp; Art programme.</p>
<p>Ashok was a staff member that was always present at our events and was always up for providing feedback on student projects, he loved to get involved and played all the games we showcased over the last few years.</p>
<p>Ashok was a regular contributor to the programme since its inception giving specialist talks around gamification and the history of games along with popping by the studios to discuss student projects. Ashok was also very involved in the PhD work of two of the current staff team within Games alongside a lot of work he did in relation to the Games Design Hub and Serious Gaming Hub which connected the staff team and students to different projects in computer science, healthcare and more.</p>
<p>However what would not be obvious is that if it wasn&rsquo;t for Ashok the BA (Hons) Games Design &amp; Art programme would not be here today. The original team that worked on creating the programme in 2013 included Ashok, Gary Wills, James Stallwood and a number of industry advisors, the industry advisors where all contacts via Ashok. My main role was to work out what a current games programme would need from all these inputs and to pull together the programme documentation and design the curriculum. It was Ashok that represented the new programme at the validation panels and supported connections within Computer Science and without his action at these panels, the programme may never have been given the green light.</p>
<p>Ashok’s connections within the Games industry, Serious Gaming and Gamification gave gravitas to the programme documentation. The initial membership with TIGA and a number of the guests within the programme come from Ashok’s connections specifically in the first year he organised guests that included <a href="https://www.raine.com/team-member/rod-cousens/">Rod Cousens</a>.</p>
<p>I am aware that Ashok has spoken highly of the programme both internally and externally and that numerous contacts we now have would not have been without Ashok. I suspect many opportunities for the programme have come from the work Ashok did on our behalf, both directly and indirectly. If it was not for Ashok’s support and help I would not be leading a successful Games Design &amp; Art programme, I love my work and the programme we run here so for this I am eternally grateful.</p>
<p>For the revalidation of the programme in 2017/18 Ashok wrote for us a brand new module The Business of Games, something the programme really needed, the module will run in the 2019/20 Academic year. I can’t believe he will not be here to deliver it. Ashok will be missed in more ways that he may have known.</p>
<p>This year we lost one of the GDA Family.</p>
